The SROs also decided, for the reasons set forth below, to file the Plan to govern how the SROs will proceed with formulating and submitting the CAT NMS Plan&#8212;and, as part of that process, how to review, evaluate, and narrow down the bids submitted in response to the request for proposal&#8212;and ultimately choosing the plan processor that would build, operate, and maintain the consolidated audit trail.</p>

        <p id="0fdb05be-986b-4f9b-987e-8bf270873be7">&#8226; the specific details and features of the CAT NMS Plan;</p>

        <p id="353028cc-c7bb-4ee3-be9f-227309ae5b78">&#8226; milestones for the creation of the consolidated audit trail.</p>
        <p id="cb736735-d518-431e-ac1a-7a8c80877db0">As part of the discussion of these &#8220;considerations,&#8221; the Participants must include &#8220;cost estimates for the proposed solution, and a discussion of the costs and benefits of alternative [sic] solutions considered but not proposed.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-11" NAME="fr_pz4-11">12</a> In addition, the Commission noted that <a href="">Rule 613</a> requires that the [Participants]: (1) Provide an estimate of the costs associated with creating, implementing, and maintaining the consolidated audit trail under the terms of the [CAT NMS Plan] submitted to the Commission for its consideration; (2) discuss the costs, benefits, and rationale for the choices made in developing the [CAT NMS Plan] submitted; and (3) provide their own analysis of the submitted [CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s] potential impact on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-5" NAME="fr_pz5-5">13</a></p>
        <p id="ff6d1c22-ed91-456e-b822-d132318dae9a">The Commission stated that these detailed requirements are &#8220;intended to ensure that the Commission and the public have sufficiently detailed information to carefully consider all aspects of the [CAT NMS Plan] ultimately submitted by the [Participants].&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A0y" NAME="fr_A0y">14</a> Indeed, the Commission expressed its expectation that &#8220;the [Participants] will seriously consider various options as they develop the [CAT NMS Plan] to be submitted to the Commission for its consideration.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AZR" NAME="fr_AZR">15</a></p>
        <p id="bd31ad74-333b-42ec-bd25-989059a761b0">In light of the numerous specific requirements of <a href="">Rule 613</a>, on March 7, 2013, the Commission granted the Participants an extension of the time in which to file the CAT NMS Plan so that the Participants could ensure that all potential options for the consolidated audit trail could be considered. As noted in the Exemptive Letter, the Participants concluded that publication of a request for proposal (&#8220;RFP&#8221;) was necessary to ensure that potential alternative solutions to creating the consolidated audit trail can be presented and considered by the Participants and that a detailed and meaningful cost/benefit analysis can be performed, both of which are required considerations to be addressed in the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
        <p id="b836f04d-857b-42b4-a023-d64fd808822a">The Participants published the RFP on February 26, 2013, and requested that any potential bidders notify the Participants of their intent to bid by March 5, 2013. Thirty-one firms submitted an intent to bid in response to the publication of the RFP; four of the firms were Participants or Affiliates of Participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-4" NAME="fr_pz6-4">16</a></p>
        <p id="dbe8347b-f927-4a1e-963f-8805f8c2418a">The Plan is intended to govern how the Participants will proceed with formulating and submitting the CAT NMS Plan&#8212;and, as part of that process, reviewing, evaluating, and narrowing down the Bids submitted in response to the RFP&#8212;and ultimately choosing the Plan Processor. Because of the important regulatory obligations that exist for each Participant with respect to the creation and operation of the consolidated audit trail, it is essential that each Participant contribute to the development of the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants recognize, however, that Participants or Affiliates of Participants may also be Bidders seeking to serve as the Plan Processor or may be included as part of a Bid. The Participants have sought to mitigate these potential conflicts of interest by including in the Plan multiple provisions, which are described below, designed to balance these competing factors. The Participants believe that the Plan achieves this balance by allowing all Participants to participate meaningfully in the process of creating the CAT NMS Plan and choosing the Plan Processor while imposing strict requirements to ensure that the participation is independent and that the process is fair and transparent.</p>
        <p id="d2df7ebe-df95-47e4-a11c-28d709f73f53">Section III of the Plan establishes the overall governance structure the Participants have chosen.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-5" NAME="fr_pz6-5">17</a> Specifically, the Participants propose establishing an Operating Committee responsible for formulating, drafting, and filing with the Commission the CAT NMS Plan and for ensuring the Participants&#8217; joint obligations under <a href="">Rule 613</a> are met in a timely and efficient manner. As set forth in Section III(B) of the Plan, each Participant will select one individual and one substitute to serve on the Operating Committee; however, other representatives of each Participant are permitted to attend Operating Committee meetings. Section III of the Plan also establishes the procedures for the Operating Committee, including provisions regarding meetings, Participants&#8217; voting rights, and voting requirements.</p>
        <p id="5d4e677b-6538-4d80-ad84-5ad735b072fc">Sections V and VI of the Plan<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-3" NAME="fr_pz7-3">18</a> set forth the process for the Participants&#8217; evaluation of Bids and the selection process for narrowing down the Bids and choosing the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-4" NAME="fr_pz7-4">19</a> Pursuant to these Sections, the evaluation of Bids and selection of the Plan Processor will be performed by a Selection Committee composed of one senior officer from each Participant (referred to as the &#8220;Voting Senior Officer&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-5" NAME="fr_pz7-5">20</a> Because of the potential conflicts of interest noted above, the Plan includes multiple requirements to increase the independence of the Voting Senior Officer who participates on the Selection Committee on behalf of a Bidding Participant.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-3" NAME="fr_pz8-3">21</a> The criteria set forth in Section V(D) of the Plan include requirements concerning the Voting Senior Officer&#8217;s job responsibilities, decision-making authority, and reporting, and require that the Bidding Participant establish functional separation between its Plan responsibilities and its business/commercial (including market operations) functions. In addition, the criteria prohibit any disclosure of information regarding the Bid to the Voting Senior Officer and prohibit the Voting Senior Officer from disclosing any non-public information gained in his or her role as such. These criteria are intended to insulate the Voting Senior Officer from any inside knowledge regarding the Bid (while also preventing any information about the evaluation process from being shared with staff preparing the Bidding Participant&#8217;s Bid) and to reduce any potential personal motivation that may exist that could improperly influence a Voting Senior Officer&#8217;s decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-4" NAME="fr_pz8-4">22</a></p>
        <p id="cd827748-174b-4dc2-a59b-07ea7a573930">Because of the integral role played by the Selection Committee, any action requiring a vote by the Selection Committee under the Plan can only be taken in a meeting in which all Participants entitled to vote are present. All votes taken by the Selection Committee are confidential and non-public, and a Participant&#8217;s individual votes will not be disclosed to other Participants or to the public. For this reason, the Plan provides that votes of the Selection Committee will be tabulated by an independent third party approved by the Operating Committee. Moreover, the Participants do not anticipate that aggregate votes or anonymized voting distribution numbers will be provided to the Participants following votes by the Selection Committee.</p>
        <p id="3245889d-afbe-4047-9a2b-6f855a6d7be4">The Plan divides the review and evaluation of Bids and selection of the Plan Processor into four separate stages. After Bids are received,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-4" NAME="fr_pz9-4">23</a> Section VI(A) of the Plan provides that the Selection Committee will review all submitted Bids to determine which Bids are Qualified Bids (i.e., Bids that contain sufficient information to allow the Voting Senior Officers to meaningfully assess and evaluate the Bid).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-5" NAME="fr_pz9-5">24</a> At this initial stage, if two-thirds or more of the Participants determine that a Bid does not meet the threshold for a Qualified Bid, the Bid will be eliminated from further consideration. The Participants believe this initial step will ensure that only those Bids meeting a minimum level of detail and sufficiency will move forward in the process, and insufficient Bids can be eliminated.</p>
        <p id="47d462c4-f542-484e-b293-601f63e00b54">Following the elimination of Bids that are not Qualified Bids, each Qualified Bidder will be provided the opportunity to present its Bid to the Selection Committee. After the Qualified Bidders have made their presentations, the Selection Committee will establish a &#8220;shortlist&#8221; of Bids that will move on in the process. The Plan provides that, if there are six or fewer Qualified Bids submitted, all of those Bids will be selected as &#8220;Shortlisted Bids.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-3" NAME="fr_pz10-3">25</a> If there are more than six but fewer than eleven Qualified Bids, the Selection Committee will choose five Shortlisted Bids, and if there are eleven or more Qualified Bids, the Selection Committee will choose 50% of the Qualified Bids as Shortlisted Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-4" NAME="fr_pz10-4">26</a></p>
        <p id="c3fe92bf-0f47-4e25-b3f2-c49a8774b014">When voting to select the Shortlisted Bids from among the Qualified Bids, each Voting Senior Officer must rank his or her selections, and the points assigned to the rankings increase in single-point increments. Thus, for example, if five Shortlisted Bids are to be chosen, each Participant will vote for its top five choices in rank order, with the first choice being given five points, the second choice four points, the third choice three points, the fourth choice two points, and the fifth choice one point. The Participants considered numerous alternative voting procedures but determined that the proposed process appropriately balances the need to differentiate among Qualified Bids while also ensuring that each Qualified Bid receives due consideration for inclusion as a Shortlisted Bid since each Voting Senior Officer must select multiple Qualified Bids for inclusion as a Shortlisted Bid. Further, while the Participants believe that the independence indicia sufficiently address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to Bids with which a Participant is affiliated, the proposed process will further</p>
        <p id="45d9120d-aa16-44e7-baf1-bae818133d73">mitigate potential conflicts because each Voting Senior Officer must select multiple unaffiliated Qualified Bids. The Participants believe this step is appropriate both to ensure that Bidders submit a complete and thorough Bid initially and so that Qualified Bidders will know whether they have a realistic opportunity to be selected as the Plan Processor after the CAT NMS Plan is approved.</p>
        <p id="5b0ac048-216a-4819-9384-0f736f4fea19">To further reduce the impact of potential conflicts of interest in choosing Shortlisted Bids, the Plan also provides that at least two Non-SRO Bids must be included as Shortlisted Bids, provided there are two Non-SRO Bids that are Qualified Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-4" NAME="fr_pz11-4">27</a> If, following the vote, no Non-SRO Bids have been selected as Shortlisted Bids, the Plan requires that the two Non-SRO Bids receiving the highest cumulative votes be added as Shortlisted Bids. If, in this scenario, a single Non-SRO Bid was a Qualified Bid, that Non-SRO Bid would be added as a Shortlisted Bid.</p>
        <p id="a838a547-9876-4cb4-930c-aed7c01b7a03">Following the selection of Shortlisted Bids, the Participants will identify the optimal proposed solution(s) for the consolidated audit trail for inclusion in the CAT NMS Plan for submission to the Commission. Following approval of the CAT NMS Plan by the Commission, the Selection Committee will determine, by majority vote, which Shortlisted Bidders will be provided the opportunity to revise their Bids in light of the provisions in the final, approved CAT NMS Plan. In making a decision whether to permit a Shortlisted Bidder to revise its Bid, the Selection Committee will consider the provisions in the CAT NMS Plan as well as the content of the Shortlisted Bidder&#8217;s initial Bid. To reduce potential conflicts of interest, the Plan also provides that if a Bid submitted by or including a Bidding Participant or an Affiliate of a Bidding Participant is a Shortlisted Bidder, that Bidding Participant will be recused from all votes regarding whether a Shortlisted Bidder will be permitted to revise its Bid.</p>
        <p id="d7341e1d-3a0d-4318-9840-a6f90e1e421c">After any permitted revisions have been received, the Selection Committee will select the Plan Processor from the Shortlisted Bids in two rounds of voting where, subject to the recusal provision described below, each Participant has one vote. In the first round, each Participant will select a first and second choice, with the first choice receiving two points and the second choice receiving one point. The two Shortlisted Bids receiving the highest cumulative scores in the first round will advance to the second round.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz12-5" NAME="fr_pz12-5">28</a> In the event of a tie, the tie will be broken by assigning one point per vote to the tied Shortlisted Bids, and the Shortlisted Bid with the most votes will advance. If this procedure fails to break the tie, a revote will be taken on the tied Bids with each vote receiving one point. If the tie persists, the Participants will identify areas for discussion, and revotes will be taken until the tie is broken.</p>
        <p id="9181029c-9d76-49ce-aa00-68a64db8c2e4">Once two Shortlisted Bids have been chosen, the Participants will vote for a single Shortlisted Bid from the final two to determine the Plan Processor. If one or both of the final Bids is submitted by or includes a Bidding Participant or an Affiliate of a Bidding Participant, the Bidding Participant must recuse itself from the final vote. In the event of a tie, a revote will be taken. If the tie persists, the Participants will identify areas for discussion and, following these discussions, revotes will be taken until the tie is broken. As set forth in Section VII of the Plan, following the selection of the Plan Processor, the Participants will file with the Commission a statement identifying the Plan Processor and including the information required by Rule 608.</p>

As described in Section A, the Plan includes multiple provisions designed to mitigate the potential impact of these conflicts by imposing restrictions on the Voting Senior Officer and by requiring the recusal of Bidding Participants for certain votes taken by the Selection Committee.

      <p>19 Initial steps in the evaluation and selection process will be performed pursuant to the Plan; the final two rounds of evaluation and voting, as well as the final selection of the Plan Processor, will be performed pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan. The sections of the CAT NMS Plan governing these final two voting rounds are set forth in Sections VI(D) and (E) of the Plan and will be incorporated into the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants believe it is essential that the entire process be laid out in the Plan so that the Commission can consider and approve the entire evaluation and selection process, even though the final two voting rounds, including the selection of the Plan Processor, will not be conducted until after the approval of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

      <p>21 The Plan defines a &#8220;Bidding Participant&#8221; broadly to include any Participant that (1) submits a Bid; (2) is an Affiliate of an entity that submits a Bid; or (3) is included, or is an Affiliate of an entity that is included, as a Material Subcontractor as part of a Bid. A &#8220;Material Subcontractor&#8221; is &#8220;any entity that is known to the Participant to be included as part of a Bid as a vendor, subcontractor, service provider, or in any other similar capacity and, excluding products or services offered by the Participant to one or more Bidders on terms subject to a fee filing approved by the SEC, (1) is anticipated to derive 5% or more of its annual revenue in any given year from services provided in such capacity; or (2) accounts for 5% or more of the total estimated annual cost of the Bid for any given year.&#8221; The Plan provides that &#8220;[a]n entity will not be considered a &#8216;Material Subcontractor&#8217; solely due to the entity providing services associated with any of the entity&#8217;s regulatory functions as a self-regulatory organization registered with the SEC.&#8221;</p>

      <p>24 The Plan defines a Qualified Bid as &#8220;a Bid that is deemed by the Selection Committee to include sufficient information regarding the Bidder&#8217;s ability to provide the necessary capabilities to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated audit trail so that such Bid can be effectively evaluated by the Selection Committee.&#8221; The Plan provides that, &#8220;[w]hen evaluating whether a Bid is a Qualified Bid, each member of the Selection Committee shall consider whether the Bid adequately addresses the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP, and apply such weighting and priority to the factors as such member of the Selection Committee deems appropriate in his or her professional judgment.&#8221;</p>

The Commission notes, however, that Section IV(B)(2) of the Plan states, &#8220;If there are six or fewer Qualified Bids, all such Qualified Bids shall be Shortlisted Bids.&#8221; (emphasis added)</p>

In the event of a tie to select the Shortlisted Bids, all such tied Qualified Bids will be Shortlisted Bids.</p>
