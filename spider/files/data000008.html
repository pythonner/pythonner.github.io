The SROs also decided to engage in a request for proposal (&#8220;RFP&#8221;) process to help them develop the CAT NMS Plan and to solicit bids (&#8220;Bids<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-4" NAME="fr_pz2-4">4</a>&#8221;) for the role of Plan Processor to build, operate, administer, and maintain the consolidated audit trail.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-5" NAME="fr_pz2-5">5</a> In addition, on September 3, 2013, the SROs filed, for approval, the Selection Plan to govern how the SROs would proceed with formulating and submitting the CAT NMS Plan&#8212;and, as part of that process, how the SROs would review, evaluate, and narrow down the Bids submitted in response to the RFP&#8212;and ultimately selecting the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-7" NAME="fr_pz2-7">6</a> The Selection Plan was approved on February 21, 2014.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-8" NAME="fr_pz2-8">7</a></p>

First, the SROs propose to provide opportunities to accept revised Bids prior to approval of the CAT NMS Plan, and second, to allow the list of Shortlisted Bids to be narrowed prior to Commission approval of the CAT NMS Plan.

          </code>
          <p id="90a76a9d-68b4-4c3e-ab0a-2e4158b2db99">The Participants believe that providing the Shortlisted Bidders with an additional opportunity or opportunities to revise their Bids prior to the approval of the CAT NMS Plan is critical to the timely and considered selection of the Plan Processor. Since the Bidders submitted their Bids, the Participants have expended substantial effort in analyzing potential solutions for the consolidated audit trail (&#8220;CAT&#8221;) by gathering and evaluating data and information from a variety of market participants, including Bidders, broker-dealers, vendors, regulators and others. As a result, since the original Bid date, the Participants have made substantial strides in identifying characteristics of an optimal solution and formalizing these determinations in the proposed CAT NMS Plan and related technical documents. Given the development of the requirements for an optimal solution for the CAT, the Participants believe that waiting until after the approval of the CAT NMS Plan to permit the Shortlisted Bidders to revise their Bids will shortchange the Bid process to the detriment of the final plan. Moreover, given the passage of time since the original Bids, Bidders have indicated that new technological and other beneficial solutions are now available that may further improve the Bids, and, ultimately, the proposed solutions.</p>
          <p id="26b4d20c-3d59-47d5-bcf2-33c4481910c9">In addition, the Participants believe that delaying the Bid revision process until after the approval of the CAT NMS Plan will prevent Bidders from submitting, and the Participants from adequately reviewing the most relevant, informative and fulsome Bids before selecting a Plan Processor. Specifically, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)(2)(i)</a> requires the Participants to select the Plan Processor within two months after effectiveness of the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants anticipate permitting the Shortlisted Bidders to revise their Bids, pursuant to Section VI(D) of the Selection Plan, after approval of the CAT NMS Plan, if there are substantial changes to the CAT NMS Plan before the CAT NMS Plan is approved by the Commission. Therefore, the Participants will have only a short time period of two months to analyze the Shortlisted Bids &#8211; Bids that are likely to have substantial revisions after the approval of the CAT NMS Plan for the reasons discussed above. Given the very large amount of information to digest in the revised Bids and the importance of appropriately analyzing such information, the Participants do not believe that two months will be sufficient to select the Plan Processor given the limitations of the current Selection Plan. However, if the Shortlisted Bidders are able to revise their Bids to reflect the provisions of the proposed CAT NMS Plan and any draft technical materials, as well as any new technology or other relevant developments, prior to the approval of the CAT NMS Plan, then the Participants believe that they will be able to select the Plan Processor within the time limits imposed by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> in a more thoughtful and deliberative manner.</p>
          <p id="b41533ae-a23d-474a-9963-ddffcffd33fa">In addition, the Participants believe that providing the Selection Committee the discretion to further reduce the number of Shortlisted Bids, either before or after any revisions to Shortlisted Bids are accepted, would also facilitate the selection of the Plan Processor within the time limits imposed by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. Allowing the Selection Committee to reduce the number of Shortlisted Bids before approval of the CAT NMS Plan could allow the Participants to more efficiently select the Plan Processor by focusing attention on a more refined set of options during the limited two month time period for selection following approval of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

          <p id="d3b229be-3d3a-48b1-bee4-2580335b2b6f">The Participants propose amending the Selection Plan to permit the Shortlisted Bidders to revise their Bids one or more times prior to approval of the CAT NMS Plan if the Selection Committee determines, by majority vote, subject to the applicable recusal provisions, that such revisions are necessary and appropriate. The proposed amendment would not affect Section VI(D) of the Selection Plan, which allows for revisions to Shortlisted Bids following Commission approval of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
          <p id="40e850e0-32c9-4f00-abc8-560a04055622">The Participants also propose amending the Selection Plan to provide the Selection Committee discretion to narrow the set of Shortlisted Bids prior to approval of the CAT NMS Plan. Specifically, the proposed amendment would authorize another round of voting to narrow the set of Shortlisted Bids. This round of voting, which could occur either before or after any revisions to Shortlisted Bids are accepted, would be commenced upon at least a two-thirds vote of the Selection Committee, and would proceed in a manner similar to the initial round for voting for the Shortlisted Bids. Each Voting Senior Officer would choose a first, second, and third choice Shortlisted Bid, with each choice receiving a weight of, respectively, three points, two points, and one point. The three bids receiving the highest cumulative number of points would constitute the new set of Shortlisted Bids. In the event of a tie that would result in more than three final Shortlisted Bids, the votes would be recounted, excluding each Voting Senior Officer&#8217;s third choice. The three Shortlisted Bids receiving the largest number of cumulative votes in this recount would be the new Shortlisted Bids. If this recount were to result in a tie leading to a larger or equal number of final Shortlisted Bids than the initial count, the results of the initial count would constitute the new set of Shortlisted Bids. The proposed amendment also includes, for the sake of clarity, a provision ensuring that at least one Non-SRO Bid is included in the narrowed set of Shortlisted Bids. The individual scores and rankings under any vote to narrow the list of Shortlisted Bids shall be kept confidential.</p>
          <p id="85b9541f-5efd-422a-9815-429a371ffc43">Finally, the proposed amendment includes provisions with respect to the recusal of Participants that also are Shortlisted Bidders. Under this proposed provision, no Bidding Participant shall vote in the process narrowing the set of Shortlisted Bidders, if a Bid submitted by or including the Participant or an Affiliate of the Participant is a Shortlisted Bid.</p>

The SROs believe that the amendments are reasonably designed to help assure that the SROs receive more updated and informed submissions from Shortlisted Bidders before the CAT NMS Plan is finalized, thereby helping to assure that the selection of the Plan Processor for the CAT NMS Plan proceeds efficiently within the timeframe provided by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. Moreover, the SROs believe that the amended process will facilitate the development of an audit trail that maximizes its regulatory utility while minimizing unnecessary costs, to the benefit of all market participants. Furthermore, providing the ability to narrow the list of Bidders at an earlier stage will prevent Bidders whose Bids are unlikely to be selected from misallocating their resources toward the further development of their Bid.</p>
