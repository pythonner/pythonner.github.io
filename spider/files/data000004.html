These assessments occurred in 2015 and 2016.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-9" NAME="fr_pz6-9">13</a> Ultimately, the Participants determined that, collectively, they operate pursuant to a Business Clock synchronization of 100 microseconds or less with respect to their electronic systems. The Participants that are exchanges each measured average absolute matching engine clock drift across five business days. The average measured clock drift based on this analysis was approximately 36 microseconds. However, this result was an average and the Participants do not believe that it may be relied upon as a definitive statement that all Participants currently meet a threshold of 36 microseconds. In particular, Participants&#8217; practices vary with respect to the implementation, use and measurement of synchronization. Moreover, Participants&#8217; practices also vary with respect to the frequency with which they check the accuracy of synchronization, so it may be difficult to directly compare the synchronization of one Participant to another. Participants that operate non-electronic systems, such as manual systems operated on trading floors, manual order entry devices and certain other systems, found that they do not operate at a synchronization of 100 microseconds or less. Based on these findings, the Participants proposed, and the Commission adopted, that they be subject to a Business Clock synchronization standard of 100 microseconds of the time maintained by NIST, other than Business Clocks used solely for Manual Order Events (which must comply with a standard of 1 second of the time maintained by NIST). The Participants do not believe that their practices have changed materially since the Plan was adopted.</p>

However, a majority of respondents that identified as small broker-dealers believed that there should be different Business Clock synchronization standards that apply to both (1) large broker-dealers vs. small broker-dealers (approximately 83% of small broker-dealer respondents), and (2) different types of systems (100% of small broker-dealer respondents). Large broker-dealers and small broker-dealers split on the question of whether firms voluntarily seek to improve their Business Clock synchronization standards or practices, or if firms only change such standards or practices when required to do so by regulation. Large broker-dealer respondents believed that they voluntarily seek to improve such standards or practices, while most small broker-dealer respondents indicated that they change such standards or practices when required to do so. Finally, there is no majority view with respect to how often respondents exceed applicable Business Clock synchronization thresholds, but most firms indicated that they did not know the answer to this question.

            <p id="fe03a0a5-41a2-4789-87e9-283dff111823">Approximately 55% of respondents indicated that their Business Clock synchronization tolerances did not vary based on whether Business Clocks were located in particular systems. Respondents did not express a clear majority view on the frequency with which they check the synchronization of Business Clocks. Focusing on large and small broker-dealers, the majority of large broker-dealer respondents (approximately 57%) and small broker-dealer respondents (approximately 65%) stated that their synchronization tolerances do not vary based on where a Business Clock is located. Approximately 19% of large broker-dealer respondents indicated that their synchronization tolerances vary based on where Business Clocks are located; by comparison, no small broker-dealer respondents indicated that their tolerances vary based on the location of Business Clocks. Approximately 25% of large broker-dealer respondents and approximately 35% of small broker-dealer respondents did not know if their tolerances vary based on where Business Clocks are located.</p>
            <p id="4953da57-c936-4c33-beb6-8ccfac7b7ea3">Generally, respondents reported that NTP was the most common technology used to maintain Business Clock synchronization, although, with respect to co-located systems in particular, PTP was the most common technology used. The most common response among large broker-dealer respondents (approximately 40%) was that they employ multiple technologies to maintain synchronization. Small broker-dealer respondents most commonly (approximately 30%) indicated that they use NTP to maintain synchronization; however, approximately 41% of small broker-dealer respondents did not know what technology they use to maintain synchronization. Overall, the NIST atomic clock was the most common master clock used by respondents.</p>

As discussed further below, the Participants do not believe that it is appropriate to amend the current Business Clock synchronization requirements set forth in the Plan at this time based on the results of the Survey.</p>
      <p id="4e4547cf-94bd-4f8d-85c2-b8098fd6bd3b">The Participants note that data collected in the survey is limited in certain ways for general applicability.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-9" NAME="fr_pz35-9">27</a> For instance, the data is heavily skewed towards larger broker-dealers (approximately 60% of all respondents), thus making its applicability to small broker-dealers (approximately 13% of all respondents) more questionable. In addition, many respondents indicated in their responses to various questions that they did not know their firm&#8217;s current practices and did not know, or cannot estimate, potential costs (i.e., with respect to implementation times and initial and ongoing monetary costs).</p>
      <p id="2ec99f12-b144-4d4d-bbf7-1f1dffc82fc8">Moreover, the Participants note that the current Business Clock synchronization standards were only recently implemented, and the Participants believe that the Participants and Industry Members should gain experience with those new standards prior to implementing more stringent or granular standards. In particular, the Participants desire to evaluate the effectiveness of current Business Clock synchronization requirements on the linkage and sequencing of independent events in the CAT, or whether more granular synchronization requirements are important to the accurate linkage and sequencing of the events. After gaining experience with</p>
      <p id="473bf9a6-4dde-4547-b853-6b88763df930">the synchronization standards and their effect on the accuracy of the CAT, the Participants believe that they will be able to analyze whether narrower clock synchronization requirements are necessary to obtain the intended regulatory goals of the CAT and whether any narrower requirements should be applied to certain groups or types of Industry Members consistent with industry standard practices. The Participants also anticipate that Industry Members, Small Industry Members and Service Providers that maintain synchronized Business Clocks will be able to provide more detailed and accurate responses after all CAT Reporters that are Industry Members and Small Industry Members are subject to the synchronization standards set forth in the Plan.</p>
      <p id="8cd295dd-5ec1-47a7-820a-6b8ce358bcf0">Nevertheless, despite these concerns and recognition of the limitations of the Survey results, the Participants provide the following suggestions for consideration at a future date regarding potential amendments related to the type of CAT Reporter, type of Industry Member and type of system.</p>

        <p id="98dc7f9a-de67-40d1-98e7-9f04b39ee463">The Participants evaluated whether it is appropriate to amend the Business Clock synchronization requirements in the Plan based on the type of CAT Reporter &#8211; Participant and Industry Members. The current clock synchronization standards impose different standards on Participants and Industry Members. Participants are required to meet a 100 microseconds standard, whereas Industry Members are required to meet a 50 milliseconds standard. The Participants do not recommend changing these standards at this time.</p>
        <p id="ad89d72b-cafa-4501-9119-65f37a1a2e34">As discussed above, the Survey focused on collecting data regarding Industry Members. The Participants, however, have reported that they comply with the 100 microseconds requirement currently set forth in the Plan. Based on prior analysis of the Participants&#8217; clock synchronization practices, the Participants believe that 100 microseconds is an appropriate synchronization standard to apply to the Participants. Moreover, at this time, the Participants do not believe that the same standard should apply to the Participants and to CAT Reporters that are Industry Members and/or Small Industry Members since the Survey results do not reflect a uniformity of synchronization thresholds among all CAT Reporters.</p>
        <p id="5551a25a-441f-407c-8fb7-bb1aaebb20f6">With regard to Industry Members, the data collected indicates that many potential CAT Reporters currently synchronize their Business Clocks at thresholds that are better (i.e., narrower) than currently required by the Plan, although not necessarily to the granularity of the Participants. For example, approximately 64% of respondents indicated that their current synchronization threshold is less than 50 milliseconds, with respondents most commonly reporting that they maintain thresholds of between 1 millisecond and 49 milliseconds (approximately 47%). By comparison, relatively few respondents indicated that they currently maintain synchronization thresholds below 1 millisecond (approximately 17%). The Participants, however, do not believe that this supports decreasing the synchronization thresholds applicable to all Industry Members as a group at this time. As discussed in this assessment, the sample set is heavily skewed toward large broker-dealers (approximately 80% of respondents providing data on current synchronization thresholds), and the Participants have not had an opportunity to fully evaluate the extent to which the Survey respondents represent large broker-dealers, so additional information is necessary before the Plan may be amended.</p>

        <p id="057c4ff2-aecb-4a68-aa1c-30d86378bbc2">The Participants evaluated whether it is appropriate to amend the Business Clock synchronization requirements in the Plan based on the type of Industry Member (e.g., ATS, small broker-dealer) when establishing appropriate industry standards. Recognizing the limitations of the Survey, the data suggests that many large-broker dealer respondents may already meet or exceed the standard set forth in the Plan. However, as discussed below, the Participants believe that additional analysis is necessary for implementing any narrower thresholds that are generally applicable to Industry Members or applicable to a particular subset thereof.</p>
        <p id="c6df4e78-a5ba-44a6-ba28-1e8b186823ed">The Survey data preliminarily suggests many large broker-dealers currently synchronize their Business Clocks at thresholds that are better (i.e., narrower) than currently required by the Plan. For example, 69% of the large broker-dealer respondents indicated that they have current thresholds of less than the current 50 millisecond standard. In particular, large broker-dealer respondents reported that they used the following standards: 1 microsecond to 499 microseconds (approximately 12%); 500 microseconds to 999 microseconds (approximately 6%); 1 millisecond to 49 milliseconds (approximately 51%); 50 milliseconds to 499 milliseconds (approximately 12%); and 500 milliseconds to 1 second (approximately 3%). Approximately 16% of large broker-dealer respondents did not know their firm&#8217;s current threshold. Moreover, many large broker-dealer respondents indicated that it would take them no time to comply with narrower standards of 5 milliseconds (approximately 23%), 1 millisecond (approximately 23%), 500 microseconds (approximately 14%) and 100 microseconds (approximately 13%). Although these results do not reflect a consensus among large broker-dealer respondents, the Participants believe that future analysis may indicate that compliance implementation times will decrease due to technological advances in the industry and after large broker-dealers gain experience reporting to the Central Repository. However, large broker-dealer respondents, without a majority or consensus view, also indicated that they would incur a range of costs to comply with narrower synchronization thresholds, with some estimating costs of $5 million or more to comply with thresholds below 1 millisecond. Accordingly, the Participants believe that, although large broker-dealers may be able to comply with a narrower synchronization standard without significant costs in terms of implementation time, monetary costs may be significant and possibly prohibitive. The SEC expressed a similar view when it recently approved the Plan. It explained, &#8220;[w]hile the Commission believes that regulators&#8217; ability to sequence orders accurately in certain cases could improve if the clock synchronization for Industry Members were finer, the Commission is sensitive to the costs associated with requiring a finer clock synchronization [standard] for Industry Members at this time, and believes that a standard of 50 milliseconds for Industry Members will allow regulators to sequence orders and events with a level of accuracy that is acceptable for the initial phases of CAT reporting.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-6" NAME="fr_pz37-6">28</a></p>
        <p id="932bbb5e-8ca7-40ab-b37d-d0097d74ef21">The Survey results suggest that it would be premature to lower the clock synchronization standards with regard to small broker-dealers. As noted, the number of respondents that identified as small broker-dealers was limited; only 13% of the respondents identified as small broker-dealers, which does not provide a representative view of small broker-dealers in the industry. Moreover, only approximately 30% of small broker-dealer respondents reported that they used a synchronization threshold less than the 50 milliseconds standard. Specifically, small broker-dealer respondents reported the following current thresholds: 500 microseconds to 999 microseconds (approximately 19%); 1 millisecond to 49 milliseconds (approximately 11%); 50 milliseconds to 499 milliseconds (approximately 26%); 500 milliseconds to 1 second (approximately 11%); and more than one second (approximately 7%). Approximately 26% of small broker-dealer respondents did not know their firm&#8217;s current threshold. Some, but not a majority or a representative sample, of small broker-dealer respondents indicated that it would take them no time to comply with narrower standards of 5 milliseconds (approximately 29%), 1 millisecond (approximately 17%), 500 microseconds (approximately 33%) and 100 microseconds (approximately 33%). However, as discussed throughout this assessment, the number of respondents that identified as small broker-dealers was limited, which suggests that this data may not be representative of small broker-dealers generally. In addition, given that, throughout the development of the CAT NMS Plan, small broker-dealers and industry associations have noted that they believe that small broker-dealers will be disproportionately burdened when it comes to complying with the Plan requirements, the Participants believe that it is necessary to understand the potential impact of any amendment to the Plan on small broker-dealers. For instance, as was the case with large broker-dealer respondents, small broker-dealer respondents indicated a range of potential costs to comply with a narrower synchronization threshold without a clear consensus or majority view. Although many small broker-dealers estimated that they would incur substantial costs to comply with narrower standards, a significant portion of small broker-dealer respondents could not estimate anticipated compliance costs.</p>
        <p id="e830e0ec-6a0c-4200-943c-a5f81f47a9ce">The Survey results also suggest that it may not be appropriate to subject ATSs to narrower synchronization standards at this time. Few ATS respondents indicated that it would take them no time to comply with narrower thresholds of: 5 milliseconds (approximately 18%); 1 millisecond (approximately 29%); 500 microseconds (approximately 17%); and 100 microseconds (0%). Moreover, many ATSs reported that they would incur significant costs to comply with narrower synchronization thresholds. For instance, for thresholds of 500 microseconds and 100 microseconds, the majority of ATS respondents estimated that they would incur initial compliance costs between $1 million and $20 million (approximately 57% each for thresholds of 500 microseconds and 100 microseconds). However, as is the case with data from small broker-dealer respondents, in some respects the data provided by ATS respondents is limited.

        <p id="695183da-862c-45ce-bb8c-242fa23fa500">The Participants evaluated whether it is appropriate to amend the Business Clock synchronization requirements in the Plan based on the type of system, including: order origination systems; order routing systems; order execution or matching systems; co-located systems; internalization systems; back-office systems; and third-party systems (including vendor systems). Based on the Survey, the Participants do not believe that it is appropriate to apply different synchronization thresholds to different types of systems at this time.</p>
        <p id="bacef691-4f34-4785-ba30-a68587121580">The Survey results did not indicate any consistent patterns that would necessarily support implementing a narrower or higher threshold for particular systems. For instance, with the exception of third-party systems, the majority of respondents that submitted system-level responses indicated that Business Clocks in those systems tend to be narrower than required by the Plan. However, given the ranges provided in the Survey, the Participants cannot precisely determine the current synchronization thresholds commonly used in the various systems addressed in the Survey. Moreover, of the respondents that provided information regarding current synchronization thresholds, approximately 55% indicated that their Business Clock synchronization tolerances did not vary based on whether Business Clocks were located in particular systems. Approximately 19% of large broker-dealer respondents indicated that their synchronization tolerances varied based on where Business Clocks were located; by comparison, no small broker-dealer respondents indicated that their tolerances varied based on location of Business Clocks. This further indicates that additional analysis is necessary to better determine whether, if required to do so, CAT Reporters would be capable of complying with synchronization thresholds that vary by type of system, or whether the costs of doing so would be significant or otherwise prohibitive.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-8" NAME="fr_pz39-8">31</a></p>

The Participants will reassess whether the Business Clock synchronization requirements remain consistent with industry standards &#8211; or whether it may be necessary to amend such requirements &#8211; in the future as part of the annual assessment required by <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(c) of the Plan</a>. To make such an assessment, the Participants intend to continue working with the Advisory Committee and the industry generally, including CAT Reporters of various sizes and types, to determine whether current Business Clock synchronization practices have changed sufficiently to suggest that narrower synchronization thresholds may be consistent with industry standards. As the Commission noted when it approved the Plan, if the Participants determine based on a future assessment that the clock synchronization requirements in the Plan should be changed, the Participants would need to file a proposed amendment to the Plan with the Commission. Such a submission would enable the Commission, as well as Industry Members and the public, to evaluate the proposed requirements, including anticipated costs, benefits and related implementation time frames.</p>

      <p>26 These respondents indicated that key challenges with respect to synchronizing Business Clocks in geographically disparate systems generally relate to time, monetary costs and resources. One respondent also indicated that challenges include signal quality (e.g., GPS line of site and GPS jamming), network congestion, protocol and software selection and configuration, and real-time monitoring and alerting. Another respondent indicated that traceability across multiple systems is its primary challenge.</p>

      <p>27 In connection with future assessments of the Business Clock synchronization standards set forth in the Plan, the Participants will consider how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of collecting data from CAT Reporters and the securities industry generally. For instance, the Participants may elect to, without limitation: use targeted studies/surveys or small group discussions with particular types of Industry Members; collect data regarding synchronization practices and thresholds from certain types of Industry Members (e.g., those with the lowest synchronization thresholds) and compare the data to the Participants&#8217; practices and thresholds; analyze data recorded in Industry Members&#8217; synchronization logs; or recommend the implementation of pilot programs where certain CAT Reporters would comply with a narrower synchronization threshold for a period of time to give the Participants an opportunity to assess the costs, benefits and general utility of a narrower threshold.</p>

      <p>30 The Participants believe that it may be appropriate for any future assessment of the costs and benefits of imposing a narrower synchronization threshold on ATSs to take into consideration that ATSs often act in a manner similar to exchanges.</p>

      <p>31 In a future assessment, it may be appropriate to consider whether certain types of Industry Members &#8211; such as electronic trading firms using a business model that relies on low latency trading strategies &#8211; should be subject to narrower synchronization standards, to the extent that the nature of their business would, in practice, require them to use such narrower standards. The Participants will consider collecting additional data in future assessments to evaluate this question.</p>
