Neither such Officer shall receive or be entitled to any compensation from the Company or any Participant by virtue of his or her service in such capacity (other than, if a Participant is then serving as the Plan Processor, compensation paid to such Officer as an employee of such Participant). Each such Officer shall report directly to the Operating Committee. The Chief Compliance Officer shall work on a regular and frequent basis with the Compliance Subcommittee and/or other Subcommittees as may be determined by the Operating Committee. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, including Section 6.2, each such Officer shall have such fiduciary and other duties with regard to the Plan Processor as imposed by the Plan Processor on such individual by virtue of his or her employment by the Plan Processor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall require the Plan Processor, in a written agreement with the Company, to acknowledge that the Officers of the Company owe fiduciary duties to the Company (set forth in Section 4.7(c) of this Agreement), and that, to the extent that the duties owed to the Company by the Officers of the Company, including the Chief Compliance Officer or Chief Information Security Officer, conflict with any duties owed to the Plan Processor, the duties to the Company will control.</p>
        <p id="13797273-ed35-4bb8-82e0-61bc8ce41b42">(b) The Plan Processor shall inform the Operating Committee of the individual who has direct management responsibility for the Plan Processor&#8217;s performance of its obligations with respect to the CAT. Subject to approval by the Operating Committee of such individual, the Operating Committee shall appoint such individual as an Officer. In addition, the Operating Committee by Supermajority Vote may appoint other Officers as it shall from time to time deem necessary, and may assign any title to any such Officer as it deems appropriate. Any Officer appointed pursuant to this Section 4.6(b) shall have only such duties and responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement or as the Operating Committee shall from time to time expressly determine, but no such Officer shall have any authority to bind the Company (which authority is vested solely in the Operating Committee) or be an employee of the Company, unless in each case the Operating Committee, by Supermajority Vote, expressly determines otherwise. No person subject to a &#8220;statutory disqualification&#8221; (as defined in <a href="">Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act</a>) may serve as an Officer. It is the intent of the Participants that the Company have no employees.</p>

The Company shall not indemnify an indemnified Person to the extent such Person is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Company makes any indemnification payments to an indemnified Person and such Person is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Person shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Company to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. The rights granted pursuant to this Section 4.8(b) shall be deemed contract rights, and no amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 4.8(b) shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or Proceedings arising prior to any amendment, modification or repeal. It is expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this Section 4.8(b) could involve indemnification for negligence or under theories of strict liability.

Early in the process, the Participants concluded that the publication of a request for proposal soliciting Bids from interested parties to serve as the Plan Processor for the CAT was necessary prior to filing the CAT NMS Plan to ensure that potential alternative solutions to creating the CAT could be presented and considered by the Participants and that a detailed and meaningful cost/benefit analysis could be performed, both of which are required considerations to be addressed in the CAT NMS Plan. To that end, the Participants published the RFP on February 26, 2013,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz89-5" NAME="fr_pz89-5">5</a> and 31 firms formally notified the Participants of their intent to bid.</p>
      <p id="cac73e89-c409-4c2b-9594-1ea8bac76cbb">On September 3, 2013, the Participants filed with the Commission the Selection Plan, a national market system plan to govern the process for Participant review of the Bids submitted in response to the RFP, the procedure for evaluating the Bids, and, ultimately, selection of the Plan Processor. Several critical components of the Participants&#8217; process for formulating and drafting the CAT NMS Plan were contingent upon approval of the Selection Plan, which occurred on February 21, 2014.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz89-6" NAME="fr_pz89-6">6</a> Bids in response to the RFP were due four weeks following approval of the Selection Plan, on March 21, 2014. Ten Bids were submitted in response to the RFP.</p>
      <p id="817c4fae-570e-4e37-83bd-e133c797e277">The Participants considered each Bid in great detail to ensure that the Participants can address the considerations enumerated in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, including analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed solution(s), as well as alternative solutions considered but not proposed, so that the Commission and the public will have sufficiently detailed information to carefully consider all aspects of the CAT NMS Plan the Participants ultimately submit. Soon after receiving the Bids, and pursuant to the Selection Plan, the Participants determined that all ten Bids were &#8220;qualified&#8221; pursuant to the Selection Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz89-7" NAME="fr_pz89-7">7</a> On July 1, 2014, after the Participants had hosted Bidder presentations to learn additional details regarding the Bids and conducted an analysis and comparison of the Bids, the Participants voted to select six Shortlisted Bidders.</p>
      <p id="20b5c6b9-3a49-4813-a11a-9b7e6cd79848">Under the terms of the Selection Plan, and as incorporated into the CAT NMS Plan, the Plan Processor for the CAT has not been selected and will not be selected until after approval of the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz89-8" NAME="fr_pz89-8">8</a> Any one of the six remaining Shortlisted Bidders could be selected as the Plan Processor, and because each Shortlisted Bidder has proposed different approaches to various issues, the CAT NMS Plan does not generally mandate specific technical approaches; rather, it mandates specific requirements that the Plan Processor must meet, regardless of approach. Where possible, this Appendix C discusses specific technical requirements the Participants have deemed necessary for the CAT; however, in some instances, provided the Plan Processor meets certain general obligations, the specific approach taken in implementing aspects of the CAT NMS Plan will be dependent upon the Bidder ultimately selected as the Plan Processor.</p>

However, in the Exemptive Request Letters, the Participants request relief that would permit CAT Reporters to provide information to the Central Repository using Firm Designated IDs instead of Customer-IDs. In addition, Industry Members are permitted to use Data Submitters that are not national securities exchanges, national securities associations, or members thereof to report the required data to the Central Repository on their behalf. The approach proposed in the Exemptive Request Letters also would permit Data Submitters to provide information to the Central Repository using Firm Designated ID for purposes of reporting information to the CAT.</p>
      <p id="7bc93e03-00c6-40da-b6fc-4c0b38ca539e">The Central Repository also is required to collect National Best Bid and National Best Offer information, transaction reports reported to an effective transaction reporting plan filed with the SEC pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 601</a>, and Last Sale Reports reported pursuant to the OPRA Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-7" NAME="fr_pz92-7">17</a> Consequently, the Plan Processor must receive information from the SIPs for those plans and incorporate that information into the CAT.

      <p id="bcb8fcbf-4c57-433f-9892-d11707f0fd91">The Plan Processor will be required to ensure that each CAT Reporter is able to access its submissions for error correction purposes and transmit their data to the Central Repository on a daily basis. The Plan Processer must have a robust file management tool that is commercially available, including key management. In addition, at a minimum, the Plan Processor must be able to accept data from CAT Reporters and other Data Submitters via automated means (e.g., Secure File Transfer Protocol (&#8220;SFTP&#8221;)) as well as manual entry means (e.g., GUI interface).</p>
      <p id="0ec2463f-fb25-4a47-b5ba-0d85fb9f1b78">The Plan Processor will be required to ensure that all file processing stages are handled correctly. This will include the start and stop of data reception, the recovery of data that is transmitted, the retransmission of data from CAT Reporters, and the resynchronization of data after any data loss. At a minimum, this will require the Plan Processor to have logic that identifies duplication of files. If transmission is interrupted, the Plan Processor must specify:</p>

After careful consideration, including numerous discussions with the DAG, the Participants concluded that the CAT NMS Plan should use a reporting model that requires broker-dealers to provide detailed account and Customer information to the Central Repository, including the specific identities of all Customers associated with each account, and have the Central Repository correlate the Customer information across broker-dealers, assign a unique customer identifier to each Customer (i.e., the Customer-ID), and use that unique customer identifier consistently across all CAT Data (hereinafter, the &#8220;Customer Information Approach&#8221;).</p>
      <p id="bb91cb48-3ba2-4357-86ed-f2354fd7cc1c">Under the Customer Information Approach, the CAT NMS Plan would require each broker-dealer to assign a unique Firm Designated ID to each customer, as that term is defined in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. For the Firm Designated ID, broker-dealers would be permitted to use an account number or any other identifier defined by the firm, provided each identifier is unique across the firm for each business date (i.e., a single firm may not have multiple separate customers with the same identifier on any given date). Under the Customer Information Approach, broker-dealers must submit an initial set of customer information to the Central Repository, including, as applicable, the Firm Designated ID for the customer, name, address, date of birth, Individual Tax ID (&#8220;ITIN&#8221;)/social security number (&#8220;SSN&#8221;), individual&#8217;s role in the account (e.g., primary holder, joint holder, guardian, trustee, person with the power of attorney) and Legal Entity Identifier (&#8220;LEI&#8221;),<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-8" NAME="fr_pz95-8">31</a> and/or Large Trader ID (&#8220;LTID&#8221;), if applicable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-9" NAME="fr_pz95-9">32</a> Under the Customer Information Approach, broker-dealers would be required to submit to the Central Repository daily updates for reactivated accounts, newly established or revised Firm Designated IDs, or associated reportable Customer information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz96-9" NAME="fr_pz96-9">33</a></p>
      <p id="920a5ee8-28aa-462d-acef-9e3eac623900">Within the Central Repository, each Customer would be uniquely identified by identifiers or a combination of identifiers such as TIN/SSN, date of birth, and, as applicable, LEI and LTID. The Plan Processor would be required to use these unique identifiers to map orders to specific customers across all broker-dealers. Broker-dealers would therefore be required to report only Firm Designated ID information on each new order submitted to the Central Repository rather than the &#8220;Customer-ID&#8221; as set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(c)(7)</a>, and the Plan Processor would associate specific customers and their Customer-IDs with individual order events based on the reported Firm Designated ID.</p>
      <p id="461318b8-e812-4002-90e6-238a0b760ac3">The Customer-ID approach is strongly supported by the industry as it believes that to do otherwise would interfere with existing business practices and risk leaking proprietary order and customer information into the market.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz96-10" NAME="fr_pz96-10">34</a> To adopt such an approach, however, requires certain exemptions from the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. Therefore, the Participants included the Customer Information Approach in the Exemptive Request Letters so that this approach could be included in the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="9c113425-958a-4bc9-ace2-718efdcbf373">In addition to the approach described above, the CAT NMS Plan details a number of requirements which the Plan Processor must meet regarding Customer and Customer Account Information.</p>
      <p id="84646b1d-bba4-4ace-8e52-45812a8e509d">The Plan Processor must maintain information of sufficient detail to uniquely and consistently identify each Customer across all CAT Reporters, and associated accounts from each CAT Reporter. The Plan Processor must document and publish, with the approval of the Operating Committee, the minimum list of attributes to be captured to maintain this association.</p>
      <p id="a1ccc4fc-190f-44ef-a6c4-05b757d5e9d5">The CAT Processor must maintain valid Customer and Customer Account Information for each Trading Day and provide a method for Participants and the SEC to easily obtain historical changes to that information (e.g., name changes, address changes).</p>
      <p id="ca06218c-624a-48f7-ac60-014fb9db8871">The CAT Processor will design and implement a robust data validation process for submitted Firm Designated ID, Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information.</p>
      <p id="d7bff570-ff26-4c50-8ba6-60b5fec89ae7">The Plan Processor must be able to link accounts that move from one CAT Reporter to another due to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, and other events. Under the approach proposed by the Participants, broker-dealers will initially submit full account lists for all active accounts to the Plan Processor and subsequently submit updates and changes on a daily basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-8" NAME="fr_pz97-8">35</a> In addition, the Plan Processor must have a process to periodically receive full account lists to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the account database.</p>
      <p id="7e2067b6-69d3-47dc-8d4f-636cf47f9f5f">In the RFP, the Participants asked for a description of how Customer and Customer Account Information will be captured, updated and stored with associated detail sufficient to identify each Customer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-9" NAME="fr_pz97-9">36</a> All Bidders anticipated Customer and Customer Account Information to be captured in an initial download of data. The precise method(s) by which CAT Reporters submit Customer data to the Central Repository will be set out in the Technical Specifications provided by the Plan Processor in accordance with Section 6.9 of the CAT NMS Plan. Data capture would occur using both file-based and entry screen methods. Data validation would check for potential duplicates with error messages being generated for follow-up by CAT Reporters. Data Reporters can update data as needed or on a predetermined schedule.</p>

Each of the Bidders indicated that it was able to meet these timeframes.</p>
      <p id="3247a7e8-9623-4003-a607-8e0cca66d969">However, the industry expressed concern that reducing the error repair window will constitute a significant burden to Data Submitters and also question whether the proposed error correction timeframe is possible.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-10" NAME="fr_pz97-10">37</a> Financial Information Forum (&#8220;FIF&#8221;) supports maintaining the current OATS Error Handling timelines, which allows for error correction within five OATS business days from the date of original submission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-11" NAME="fr_pz97-11">38</a> Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (&#8220;SIFMA&#8221;) also recommends a five-day window for error correction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-12" NAME="fr_pz97-12">39</a> Nevertheless, the Participants believe that it is imperative to the utility of the Central Repository that corrected data be available to regulators as soon as possible and recommend the three-day window for corrections to balance the need for regulators to access corrected data in a timely manner while considering the industry&#8217;s concerns.</p>

      <p id="437a1b78-4272-4594-beaa-549fecbb2364">The Central Repository must receive, extract, transform, load, and retain the data submitted by CAT Reporters and other Data Submitters. In addition, the Plan Processor is responsible for ensuring that the CAT contains all versions of data submitted by a CAT Reporter or other Data Submitter (i.e., the Central Repository must include different versions of the same information, including such things as errors and corrected data).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-13" NAME="fr_pz98-13">40</a></p>
      <p id="6ecd4774-a3a9-4bfa-95e2-8971051ad226">In the RFP, the Participants requested that each Bidder perform a detailed analysis of current industry systems and interface specifications to propose and develop their own format for collecting data from the various data sources relevant under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, as outlined in the RFP.

      <p id="0137cbb7-412c-47b1-8f16-3bfe4a72dfa3">There are two general approaches by which the Central Repository could receive information. Approach 1 described a scenario in which broker-dealers would submit relevant data to the Central Repository using their choice of existing industry messaging protocols, such as the Financial Information eXchange (&#8220;FIX&#8221;) protocol. Approach 2 provided a scenario in which broker-dealers would submit relevant data to the Central Repository using a defined or specified format, such as an augmented version of OATS.</p>
      <p id="76f82261-8a72-4cd4-9613-83cddd108999">Following receipt of data files, the Plan Processor will be required to send an acknowledgement of data received to CAT Reporters and third party Data Submitters. This acknowledgement will enable CAT Reporters to create an audit trail of their data submissions and allow for tracing of data breakdowns if data is not received. The minimum requirements for receipt acknowledgement are detailed in Appendix D, Receipt of Data from Reporters.</p>
      <p id="c5d2e6cf-7ce1-4fa3-9be6-b1e8b8d30d7c">Once the Central Repository has received the data from the CAT Reporters, it will extract individual records from the data, and validate the data through a review process that must be described in the Technical Specifications involving context, syntax, and matching validations. The Plan Processor will need to validate data and report back to any CAT Reporter any data that has not passed validation checks according to the requirements in Appendix D, Receipt of Data from Reporters. To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data in the Central Repository, data that does not pass the basic validation checks performed by the Plan Processor must be rejected until it has been corrected by the CAT Reporter responsible for submitting the data/file. After the Plan Processor has processed the data, it must provide daily statistics regarding the number of records accepted and rejected to each CAT Reporter.</p>
      <p id="4e613a67-2db2-4ae0-94f2-6e7c8c5704c0">The Plan Processor also will be required to capture rejected records for each CAT Reporter and make them available to the CAT Reporter. The &#8220;rejects&#8221; file must be accessible via an electronic file format, and the rejections and daily statistics must also be available via a web interface. The Plan Processor must provide functionality for CAT Reporters to amend records that contain exceptions. The Plan Processor must also support bulk error correction so that rejected records can be resubmitted as a new file with appropriate indicators for rejection repairs. The Plan Processor must, in these instances, reprocess repaired records. In addition, a web GUI must be available for CAT Reporters to make updates, including corrections, to individual records or attributes. The Plan Processor must maintain a detailed audit trail capturing corrections to and replacements of records.</p>
      <p id="232c37cc-b94f-4332-80fd-7cdc1dcc7896">The Plan Processor must provide CAT Reporters with documentation that details how to amend/upload records that fail the required validations, and if a record does not pass basic validations, such as syntax rejections, then it must be rejected and sent back to the CAT Reporter as soon as possible, so it can be repaired and resubmitted.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-6" NAME="fr_pz99-6">50</a> In order for regulators to have access to accurate and complete data as expeditiously as practicable, the Plan Processor will provide CAT Reporters with their error reports as they become available, and daily statistics must be provided after data has been uploaded and validated. The reports will include descriptive details as to why each data record was rejected by the Plan Processor.</p>
      <p id="ccc0c3f4-6953-4ffe-88be-6aa837f328a9">In addition, on a monthly basis, the Plan Processor should produce and publish reports detailing CAT Reporter performance and comparison statistics, similar to the report cards published for OATS presently. These reports should include data to enable CAT Reporters to assess their performance in comparison to the rest of their industry peers and to help them assess the risk related to their reporting of transmitted data.</p>
      <p id="ff04214c-2e98-4765-81d5-2cbcd3136261">CAT Reporters will report data to the Central Repository either in a uniform electronic format, or in a manner that would allow the Central Repository to convert the data to a uniform electronic format, for consolidation and storage. The Technical Specifications will describe the required format for data reported to the Central Repository.

Typically, these orders are referenced by exchange systems on a net credit/debit basis, which can cover between two and twelve different components. Such &#8220;complex orders&#8221; must also be handled and referenced within the CAT. The Bidder must develop, in close consultation with Industry Members, a linking mechanism that will allow the CAT to link the option leg(s) to the related equity leg or the individual options components to each other in a multi-leg strategy scenario.</p>
      <p id="817e6910-13ec-4378-8a5f-356d12ae237f">Once a lifecycle is assembled by the CAT, individual lifecycle events must be stored so that each unique event (e.g., origination, route, execution, modification) can be quickly and easily associated with the originating customer(s) for both targeted queries and comprehensive data scans. For example, an execution on an exchange must be linked to the originating customer(s) regardless of how the order may have been aggregated, disaggregated, and routed through multiple broker-dealers before being sent to the exchange for execution.</p>

The Plan Processor must include a notification process that informs users when reports are available, and there should be multiple methods by which query results can be obtained (e.g., web download, batch feed). Regulatory staff also must have the ability to create interim tables for access / further investigation. In addition, the Plan Processor must provide a way to limit the number of rows from a result set on screen with full results being created as a file to be delivered via a file transfer protocol.</p>

To achieve this objective, a comprehensive set of data validations must be developed that addresses both data quality and completeness. For any data that fails to pass these validations, the Plan Processor will be required to handle data correction and resubmission within established timeframes both in a batch process format and via manual web-based entry.</p>

As discussed in the NMS Plan, there are a minimum of three validation processes that will be performed on data submitted to the Central Repository. The Plan Processor will be required to identify specific validations and metrics to define the Data Quality Governance requirements, as defined in Appendix D, Receipt of Data from Reporters.</p>

      <p id="d1af7a7f-de06-4afd-9157-a8e8d248cdcf">The Participants considered industry experience with FINRA&#8217;s OATS system over the last 10 years. During that timeframe there have been three major industry impacting releases. These three releases are known as (1) OATS Phase III, which required manual orders to be reported to OATS;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz111-6" NAME="fr_pz111-6">103</a> (2) OATS for OTC Securities which required OTC equity securities to be reported to OATS;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz111-7" NAME="fr_pz111-7">104</a> and (3) OATS for NMS which required all NMS stocks to be reported to OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz111-8" NAME="fr_pz111-8">105</a> Each of these releases was accompanied by significant updates to the required formats which required OATS reporters to update and test their reporting systems and infrastructure.</p>
      <p id="9962b65f-d1ca-4c31-8553-cdcba75f7e94">The combined average error rates for the time periods immediately following release across five significant categories for these three releases follow. The average rejection percentage rate, representing order events that did not pass systemic validations, was 2.42%. The average late percentage rate, representing order events not submitted in a timely manner, was 0.36%. The average order / trade matching error rate, representing OATS Execution Reports unsuccessfully matched to a TRF trade report was 0.86%. The average Exchange/Route matching error rate, representing OATS Route Reports unsuccessfully matched to an exchange order was 3.12%. Finally, the average Interfirm Route matching error rate, representing OATS Route Reports unsuccessfully matched to a report representing the receipt of the route by another reporting entity was 2.44%. Although the error rates for the 1999 initial OATS implementation were significantly higher than those laid out above, the Participants believe that technical innovation and institutional knowledge of audit trail creation over the past 15 years makes the more recent statistics a better standard for the initial Error Rate.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz111-9" NAME="fr_pz111-9">106</a> Based upon these historical error rates, and given that reporting to the Central Repository will involve reporting on new products (i.e., options) and reporting by new reporters (including both broker-dealers and Participants who have not previously been required to report to OATS), the Participants believe that the initial Error Rate will be higher than the recent rates associated with OATS releases and that an initial Error Rate of 5% is an appropriate standard.</p>
      <p id="f740b52a-5b21-42b7-9d4b-be86a5abfdd1">The Participants believe that to achieve this Error Rate, however, the Participants and the industry must be provided with ample resources, including a stand-alone test environment functionally equivalent to the production environment, and time to test their reporting systems and infrastructure. Additionally, the Technical Specifications must be well written and effectively communicated to the reporting community with sufficient time to allow proper technical updates, as necessary. The Participants believe that the Error Rate strikes the balance of adapting to a new reporting regime, while ensuring that the data provided to regulators will be capable of being used to conduct surveillance and market reconstruction, as well as having a sufficient level of accuracy to facilitate the retirement of existing regulatory reports and systems where possible.</p>

As discussed above, the CAT NMS Plan requires that CAT Reporters synchronize their clocks to within 50 milliseconds of the NIST. Because of this permitted drift, any two separate clocks can vary by 100 milliseconds: one clock can drift forward 50 milliseconds while another can drift back 50 milliseconds. Thus, it is possible to have, for example, one firm report the route of an order at 10:40:00.005 while the firm receiving the routed order reports a receipt time of 10:39:59.983 (i.e., the time stamps alone indicate that the routed order was received before it was sent). For this reason, the Participants plan to require that the Plan Processor develop a way to accurately track the sequence of order events without relying entirely on time stamps.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz113-7" NAME="fr_pz113-7">110</a></p>
      <p id="f631e8f5-6316-44f5-b637-de42e7cc4613">There were several different approaches suggested by the Bidders to accomplish the accurate sequencing of order events. Some Bidders suggested using time stamp-based sequencing; however, most Bidders recognized that, while all CAT Reporters should have their time stamp clocks synchronized, in practice this synchronization cannot be wholly relied upon due to variations in computer systems. These Bidders rely on linkage logic to derive the event sequencing chain, such as parent/child orders. To help resolve time stamp issues, one Bidder proposed adding unique sequence ID numbers as well to the event information to help with time clock issues and a few others would analyze the variations on clock time and notify those CAT Reporters that need to resynchronize their clocks.</p>
      <p id="eb1b1a36-0639-450f-a4aa-1d874ebdf82e">The Participants believe that using a linking logic not dependent on time stamps would enable proper sequencing of an order.

However, after careful consideration, including numerous discussions with the DAG, the Participants have determined that time stamp granularity at the level of a millisecond is not practical for order events that involve non-electronic communication of information (&#8220;Manual Order Events&#8221;). In particular, it is the Participants&#8217; understanding that recording Manual Order Events to the millisecond would be both very costly, requiring specialized software configurations and expensive hardware, and inherently imprecise due to the manner in which human interaction is required. The industry feedback that the Participants received through the DAG suggests that the established business practice with respect to Manual Order Events is to manually capture time stamps with granularity at the level of a second because finer increments cannot be accurately captured when dealing with manual processes which, by their nature, take longer to perform than a time increment of under one second. The Participants agree that, due to the nature of transactions originated over the phone, it is not practical to attempt granularity finer than one second, as any such finer increment would be inherently unreliable. Further, the Participants do not believe that recording Manual Order Events to the second will hinder the ability of regulators to determine the sequence in which Reportable Events occur.</p>
      <p id="2f438781-c6a6-4ae6-96d6-41edcc7029b8">As a result of these discussions, the Exemptive Request Letter requested exemptive relief from the Commission to allow the CAT NMS Plan to require Manual Order Events to be captured with granularity of up to and including one second or better, but also require CAT Reporters to report the time stamp of when a Manual Order Event was captured electronically in the relevant order handling and execution system of the party to the event. Granularity of the Electronic Capture Time will be consistent with the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(d)(3)</a> requirement that time stamps be at least to the millisecond.</p>

      <p id="066b666f-1a5e-4140-bc06-2f989e288838">As noted above, in addition to describing data security and confidentiality, all of the Bidders were required to set forth an approach to data loss recovery and business continuity in the event of data loss. All of the Bidders addressed data loss through data replication and redundancy. Some of the Bidders proposed a hot-hot design for replication for primary and secondary data, so both sites are fully operational at all times and there would be no recovery time necessary in the case of fall-over to the secondary site. However, this is a more costly solution, and many Bidders therefore proposed data loss prevention by operating in a hot-warm design for replication to a secondary site.</p>
      <p id="9c2fd5ab-a97d-4b9a-bf69-d2aaf494b33a">The Plan Processor must comply with industry best practices for disaster recovery and business continuity planning, including the standards and requirements set forth in Appendix D, BCP / DR Process.</p>
      <p id="720c003e-8e98-405c-86fd-e87daa9701b0">With respect to business continuity, the Participants have developed the following requirements that the Plan Processor must meet. In general, the Plan Processor will implement efficient and cost-effective backup and disaster recovery capability that will ensure no loss of data and will support the data availability requirements and anticipated volumes of the Central Repository. The disaster recovery site must have the same level of availability / capacity / throughput and data as the primary site. In addition, the Plan Processor will be required to design a Business Continuity Plan that is inclusive of the technical and business activities of the Central Repository, including the items specified in Appendix D, BCP / DR Process (e.g., bi-annual DR testing and an annual Business Continuity Audit).</p>

Some Bidders intend to leverage their experience in financial services and adopt their policies and technologies to control data, and many Bidders supported such measures as role-based access controls, two factor authentication, detailed system logs, and segmentation of sensitive data that is isolated in both logical and physical layers. Other Bidders indicated that they would use role-based security policies, data and file encryption, and redundant and layered controls to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, Bidders noted that the physical locations at which data is stored need security measures to ensure data is not compromised. Some Bidders indicated that physical controls would include background checks for employees working with the system; physical building security measures (e.g., locks, alarms, key control programs, CCTV monitoring for all critical areas, and computer controlled access systems with ID badges).</p>
      <p id="02c37b01-8fbd-4c4a-b2b6-00f563e54cf4">The RFP also requested additional information specific to the treatment and control over PII. The RFP required Bidders to specifically address:</p>

      <p id="87620a5f-9744-4ec9-94f1-d9213e818b61">All of the Bidders proposed segregating PII from the other data in the Central Repository. Additionally, all of the Bidders recommended limiting access to PII to only those regulators who need to have access to such information, and requiring additional validations to access PII. Although all Bidders proposed to keep a log of access to the Central Repository by user, the Bidders suggested different methods of authentication and utilized varying security policies, including the use of VPNs or HTTPS.</p>
      <p id="accaf63c-d4cf-46a2-be6e-51c5707c265a">The RFP also requested information from Bidders on data loss prevention (&#8220;DLP&#8221;) and business continuity to ensure the continued security and availability of the data in the Central Repository.

      <p id="93669ccf-97cb-4fb9-8f78-ca58a0723dd6">The Participants anticipate that access to PII will be limited to a &#8220;need-to-know&#8221; basis. Therefore, it is expected that access to PII associated with customers and accounts will have a much lower number of registered users, and access to this data will be limited to Participants&#8217; staff and the SEC who need to know the specific identity of an individual. For this reason, PII such as SSN and TIN will not be made available in the general query tools, reports, or bulk data extraction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz122-7" NAME="fr_pz122-7">145</a> The Participants will require that the Plan Processor provide for a separate workflow granting access to PII (including an audit trail of such requests) that allows this information to be retrieved only when required by specific regulatory staff of a Participant or the SEC, including additional security requirements for this sensitive data. Specifically, the Plan Processor must take steps to protect PII as defined in Appendix D, Data Security and including items such as storage of PII separately from order and transaction data, multi-factor authentication for access to PII data, and a full audit trail of all PII data access.</p>

      <p id="3fe1c67a-0b88-4d1d-9dd0-c8ad2192be43">(b) Approaches proposed by Bidders</p>
      <p id="efc5c4aa-516d-4495-b1c0-d12fe7831410">Information received from Shortlisted Bidders indicated that all six Shortlisted Bidders considered incoming transaction volumes to be one of their most significant drivers of cost across hardware, software, and full-time employees (&#8220;FTEs&#8221;), with the expected rate of increase in transaction volumes and retention requirements also being prominent drivers of cost. The approaches described above will facilitate effective management of these factors to provide for a cost-effective and flexible Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="604db849-08c9-4a28-849c-7c7d5d8709bc">As noted in the RFP, the Bidders were required to provide comments on how the Central Repository would be scalable for growth in the following aspects: number of issues accepted by the CAT, types of messages accepted by the CAT, addition of fields stored on individual data records or increases in any data type due to market growth. The Bidders were also requested to describe how the system can be scaled up for peak periods and scaled down as needed.</p>
      <p id="265b331f-e88c-4b2e-ade5-ad53a4559c40">Bidders using a network infrastructure of data collection hubs noted the use of Ethernet links throughout a single hub as a method of handling additional throughput and capacity. Other Bidders note access points will be load balanced, allowing for additional capacity. Some Bidders note the need for continued monitoring to facilitate timely addition of capacity or other upgrades. Other Bidders highlighted the ability to scale processing horizontally by adding nodes to the database structure which will allow for additional capacity. In this instance, adding nodes to an existing clustered environment allows for the preservation of processing speed in the existing processing environment. In a cloud solution, Bidders note the systems will scale automatically. That is, the processing load or capacity is determined at the instance the tool is &#8216;run&#8217; by the processer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz124-8" NAME="fr_pz124-8">146</a> Some Bidders broadly note that the selection of platform components or features of their proposed solution infrastructure was the key in developing a scalable system. It is further noted that the selection of these elements allows for technological upgrades to incorporate newer technologies without a system replacement. Bidders identify the use of additional server and storage capacity as a key proponent of providing a scalable system.</p>

      <p id="dd13bbb0-5724-4c91-adfa-3176e5a744ae">&#8226; The identity of all market participants (including broker-dealers and customers) that are allocated NMS Securities, directly or indirectly, in a Primary Market Transaction;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz124-9" NAME="fr_pz124-9">147</a></p>
      <p id="e689a443-06aa-4b57-a2aa-bf6e8ea4d8d6">&#8226; The number of such NMS Securities each such market participant is allocated; and</p>

      <p id="676ce768-3838-4b33-91ca-cb489b852b01">The objective of this CAT NMS Plan is to provide a comprehensive audit trail that &#8220;allows regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity in NMS securities throughout the U.S. markets.&#8221; The Participants believe that an eventual expansion of the CAT to gather complete information on Primary Market Transactions would be beneficial to achieving that objective. However, based on the analysis directed to be completed as part of this plan, the Participants have concluded that it is appropriate to limit CAT submissions related to allocations in Primary Market Transactions to sub-account allocations, as described below.</p>
      <p id="6ffd4ec8-edec-4c3e-b14a-372631ecf25b">Specifically, based on comments received by the Participants on this and other topics related to the consolidated audit trail,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz124-11" NAME="fr_pz124-11">149</a> the Participants believe that information related to sub-account allocations &#8211; the allocation of shares in a primary market offering to the accounts that ultimately will own them &#8211; currently is maintained by broker-dealers in a manner that would allow for reporting to the Central Repository without unreasonable costs and could assist the Commission and the Participants in their regulatory obligations, including a variety of rulemaking and policy decisions. By contrast, the reporting of so-called &#8220;top account&#8221; information in Primary Market Transactions to the Central Repository would involve significantly more costs which, when balanced against the marginal benefit, is not justified at this time. These issues are discussed further below.</p>
      <p id="8196a15e-541a-4aaa-b4b5-2aee2b8d466c">As a preliminary matter, the analysis required pursuant to this section is limited to Primary Market Transactions in NMS Securities that involve allocations. As the Commission has noted, &#8220;&#8216;a primary market transaction is any transaction other than a secondary market transaction and refers to any transaction where a person purchases securities in an offering.&#8217;&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-5" NAME="fr_pz125-5">150</a> The Participants understand that Primary Market Transactions generally involve two phases that implicate the allocation of shares. The &#8220;book building&#8221; phase involves the process &#8220;by which underwriters gather and assess investor demand for an offering of securities and seek information important to their determination as to the size and pricing of an issue.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-6" NAME="fr_pz125-6">151</a> This process may involve road shows to market an offering to potential investors, typically institutional investors, including the discussion of the prospective issuer, and its management and prospects. The book building phase also involves efforts by the underwriter to ascertain indications of interest in purchasing quantities of the underwritten securities at varying prices from potential investors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-8" NAME="fr_pz125-8">152</a> Using this and other information, the underwriter will then decide how to allocate IPO shares to purchasers. The Participants understand that these are so-called &#8220;top account&#8221; allocations &#8211; allocations to institutional clients or retail broker-dealers, and that such allocations are conditional and may fluctuate until the offering syndicate terminates. Sub-account allocations occur subsequently, and are made by top account institutions and broker-dealers prior to settlement. Sub-account allocations represent the allocation of IPO shares to the actual account receiving the shares and are based on an allocation process that is similar to secondary market transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-9" NAME="fr_pz125-9">153</a></p>
      <p id="09baf24b-251a-469f-8f0a-138f3cb23c5c">(a) Feasibility</p>
      <p id="e3240873-7e97-42ac-836d-5f5a3ac28130">In the April 2013 Request for Comment, the Participants requested information on how firms handle Primary Market Transactions. In response to the request, FIF, SIFMA and Thomson Reuters submitted comments explaining current industry practice with respect to Primary Market Transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-10" NAME="fr_pz125-10">154</a> Both SIFMA and FIF noted that broker-dealers generally maintain top account allocation information in book building systems that are separate from their systems for secondary market transactions and that differ across the industry, including the use of applications provided by third parties, in house systems and spreadsheets for small firms.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ATSO" NAME="fr_ATSO">155</a> The Participants also understand that the investment banking divisions of broker-dealers typically use different compliance systems than those used for secondary market transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aj8z" NAME="fr_Aj8z">156</a> The DAG also provided feedback<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-7" NAME="fr_pz126-7">157</a> indicating that the impacted systems differ across the industry, given differing processes for Primary Market Transactions depending upon the structure of the deal, and that initial allocations are stored in book-building systems with varying levels of sophistication across the industry, including third-party systems, custom-built systems, and spreadsheets. The Participants thus believe that capturing indications of interest and other information about top account allocations in an accurate and consistent manner across the industry would be challenging.</p>
      <p id="d5072274-e407-4ac8-aa01-4526bdedf2c6">By contrast, the Participants believe that it would be more feasible to gather information relating to sub-account allocations in Primary Market Transactions. The Participants understand that sub-account allocations are received in a manner and level of detail similar to allocations in secondary market transactions,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-9" NAME="fr_pz126-9">158</a> and that the same middle and back office systems that are used for the processing of sub-account allocations for secondary market transactions generally are also used for the sub-account allocations for Primary Market Transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-10" NAME="fr_pz126-10">159</a> Similarly, sub-account allocations for Primary Market Transactions generally are maintained in an electronic format that could be converted into a reportable format acceptable for the CAT System. Therefore, these systems could more easily report information about sub-account allocations to the Central Repository than systems containing information regarding top-account allocations.</p>
      <p id="a716b2b5-ee40-4dcb-acb8-10478cad7e57">(b) Benefits</p>
      <p id="c53dc879-14e5-4a62-ac5a-4558edd474d7">As the Commission notes, data about the final allocations of NMS Securities in Primary Market Transactions could improve compliance monitoring and market analyses by the Commission and the Participants, which, in turn, could help inform rulemaking and other policy decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-11" NAME="fr_pz126-11">160</a> For example, such data could enhance the Commission&#8217;s understanding of the role of the allocations in the capital formation process, when and how investors receiving allocations sell their Eligible Securities and how allocations differ among broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-12" NAME="fr_pz126-12">161</a> Such data also could assist the Commission and Participants in conducting their respective examinations and investigations related to Primary Market Transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-13" NAME="fr_pz126-13">162</a></p>
      <p id="c939860d-7ce6-431b-b524-55eb1d0a842c">The Participants believe that most of these potential benefits could be achieved through the gathering of information relating to sub-account allocations rather than top account information. For example, sub-account allocation information would aid the Commission and the Participants in gaining a better understanding of how shares allocated in Primary Market Transactions are sold in the secondary market, or how allocations differ across broker-dealers. By contrast, because top account information of conditional and interim allocations for NMS Securities fluctuates throughout the syndicate process and may vary significantly among firms, the marginal benefits of such information over final sub-account allocations are much less clear.</p>
      <p id="01d06f5f-5fb1-41ce-b34f-0b6294c328ba">(c) Costs</p>
      <p id="39b7b129-9308-4e49-86d5-5e7172645e94">The cost of reporting Primary Market Transaction information will depend on the scope of allocation information subject to the rule, as well as the related technology upgrades that would be necessary to report such information to the Central Repository. Based on the response of commenters, the Participants believe that reporting top account information about conditional allocations to the Central Repository would require significant technology enhancements. As noted above, current market practices capture top account allocations using systems and data sources that are different and separate from those used in secondary market transactions. Commenters also noted that there may be significant variability among underwriters in terms of the systems and applications used to gather such data.</p>
      <p id="376c7931-eb56-4f9f-bfcc-290e537e862e">The DAG provided cost estimates associated with the reporting of Primary Market Transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-7" NAME="fr_pz127-7">163</a> These estimates indicated that to report both initial and sub-account allocations would cost the industry as a whole at least $234.8 million<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-8" NAME="fr_pz127-8">164</a> and require approximately 36 person-months per firm to implement. The DAG&#8217;s estimate to report sub-account allocations only was approximately $58.7 million<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-9" NAME="fr_pz127-9">165</a> for the industry and would require approximately 12 person-months per firm to implement. The DAG commented that given the higher costs associated with reporting initial allocations, if Primary Market Transactions are required to be reported to the Central Repository, that only reporting final sub-account allocations be required.</p>
      <p id="71129b3a-2d20-49e6-aea7-9888e6861ee0">Based upon this analysis, the Participants are supportive of considering the reporting of Primary Market Transactions, but only at the sub-account level, and will incorporate analysis of this requirement, including how and when to implement such a requirement, into their document outlining how additional Eligible Securities could be reported to the Central Repository, in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(i)</a> and <a href="#f1d4f778-dd75-4aa0-936e-76811dbe7731">Section 6.11 of the Plan</a>.</p>

The Participants developed the content of the Costs to Vendors Study, based on the structure and content of the Costs to CAT Reporters Study. The distribution list for the Costs to Vendors Study was provided by the DAG, and was distributed to 13 service bureaus and technology vendors on August 13, 2014. The initial due date for responses was September 1, 2014; however, due to the complexity of the data collection effort, the due date for the study was extended to September 12, 2014. The Participants received five completed responses to the Costs to Vendors Study.</p>

      <p id="96ba06f3-8f1c-478d-b1ee-6d775b4f07f3">To estimate the costs to Participants for creating, implementing and maintaining the CAT, Bidders were asked to provide in their Bid documents total one-year and annual recurring cost estimates. As part of the RFP process, the Bidders were asked to provide a schedule of the anticipated total cost of creating, implementing and maintaining the CAT. As noted above in the Background Section of Appendix C, any one of the six Shortlisted Bidders could be selected as the Plan Processor and each Shortlisted Bidder<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-6" NAME="fr_pz131-6">173</a> has proposed different approaches to various issues. The Bidder selected as the Plan Processor must meet the specific requirements set forth in the Plan and Appendix D and may be given the opportunity to revise its Bid prior to the final selection of a Plan Processor. Accordingly, the Participants anticipate that the cost estimates to create, implement and maintain the CAT may differ from what is set forth below.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-7" NAME="fr_pz131-7">174</a></p>
      <p id="a35c3604-da36-4f1b-92ce-405e78084fd9">In its final rule for the Consolidated Audit Trail, the Commission amended its proposal to include enhanced security and privacy requirements. Specifically, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(e)(4)</a> requires the NMS Plan to include policies and procedures, including standards, to be used by the Plan Processor to ensure the security and confidentiality of all information reported to the Central Repository. Participants did not ask Bidders to separately assess the costs associated with the enhanced security requirements in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>; rather these costs were embedded in the Bids as a component of the total costs.</p>
      <p id="fbfa10f9-c71e-4392-aae4-808b96a96b97">The RFP requested that Bidders provide an estimate of the total one-time cost to build the CAT, including technological, operational, administrative, and any other material costs. The six Shortlisted Bidders provided estimates ranging from a low of $30,000,000 to a high of $91,600,000, with an average one-time cost of $53,000,000.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-8" NAME="fr_pz131-8">175</a></p>
      <p id="ed98cf16-b07e-48dc-98f5-640fa0b16f9d">The RFP also requested that Bidders provide an estimate of annual recurring operating and maintenance costs for the five year period following the selection of the Plan Processor, and an estimate of the annual peak year costs (i.e., cost for the year during which it will cost the most to operate the CAT). The six Shortlisted Bidders provided estimates ranging from a low of $135,000,000 to a high of $465,100,000 over the course of the first five years of operation, with an average five-year cost of $255,600,000 and an average annual cost of $51,100,000. Estimates of peak year recurring costs range from a low of $27,000,000 to a high of $109,800,000, with an average of $59,400,000. The table presented below reports the low, median, average, and maximum expected costs for the build, maintenance, and peak year maintenance of the Central Repository arising from the Shortlisted Bids. These figures are subject to change as Bidders may update their cost estimates.</p>
      
      <p id="457a4e78-c79e-4f4f-9163-bc3d12ead846">The Participants note, however, that there may be a relation between the initial construction costs and maintenance costs based on technological choices, among other factors. To better compare estimates, the Participants are providing a range based on the reported combined build and annual recurring costs for the five year period following Plan Processor selection, discounted by a factor of 2%.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz1-7" NAME="fr_pz1-7">176</a> Estimates of total costs range from $159,800,000 to $538,700,000.</p>
      <p id="633c899b-3b35-4c23-bb9e-f9fdc85aeb48">Participants sought insight into the economic drivers of the cost estimates from the Shortlisted Bidders. Specifically, Participants asked each Shortlisted Bidder to identify the factors, such as the amount of message traffic, complexity of order life cycles, number and complexity of Participant and Commission data requests and administration and support costs that were material to its Bid. Bidders identified the following as primary drivers of their Bid costs: (1) reportable volumes of data ingested into the Central Repository; (2) number of technical environments that would be have to be built to report to the Central Repository; (3) likely future rate of increase of reportable volumes; (4) data archival requirements; and (5) user support and/or help desk resource requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz1-8" NAME="fr_pz1-8">177</a></p>

      <p id="6125b6fa-4c41-4d2b-9b83-d525850c4f28">Such a system will necessarily impact the Commission, Participants, potential future Participant entrants, broker-dealers and other market participants, issuers and investors. Each party may derive costs, benefits and other economic impacts, depending upon plan implementation, the relevant economic activities of each entity and the allocation of costs and responsibilities across those entities. These estimated costs, benefits, and other economic impacts must be assessed against the current economic baseline, capturing the existing state of regulatory audit trail activity in the markets. The economic baseline for different affected parties is described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="57645721-23e9-46e4-b292-fa370a4f4004">(A) Description of Current Audit Trail Reporting</p>
      <p id="1ebd2d10-cd71-4ec3-b947-e7e651194fbd">Currently, separate audit trails exist within each exchange in addition to the audit trail requirements for FINRA members to report to OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-6" NAME="fr_pz2-6">179</a> For equities, all broker-dealers that are members of FINRA must report their orders in NMS Stocks and OTC Equity Securities, including executions or cancellations, to OATS. Accordingly, for FINRA members, it is possible to match OATS reports to related exchange audit trail entries, provided that the related exchange has a regulatory services agreement with FINRA such that FINRA has access to the exchange data. Broker-dealers that are not FINRA members do not have a regular equity audit trail reporting requirement, although NYSE and NASDAQ member proprietary firms that are not FINRA members have an obligation to record OATS data and report to FINRA upon request. Additionally, each exchange creates its own audit trail for each order received that it receives and processes.</p>
      <p id="96dca934-25dd-45e2-91d5-993514eb109a">For options, the options exchanges utilize the Consolidated Options Audit Trail System (&#8220;COATS&#8221;) to obtain and review information on options transactions. COATS data includes trades, the National Best Bid and National Best Offer at the time of the trade and clearing information for customers at the clearing firm level. It also identifies clearing firm proprietary trading and individual marker maker transactions if they are reported correctly at the time of the trade. However, COATS does not include adjustment data from the Options Clearing Corporation; these adjustments include changes to either the account type or size of the position. Additionally, order information is only available to the Commission upon request from the options exchanges. Currently reports need to be constructed based on order information received from the various options exchanges. As previously noted, only the National Best Bid and National Best Offer at the time of the trade is included in the COATS data; however, this is optional data that the exchanges may or may not provide. The options exchanges utilize their independent quote information to build their reports.</p>
      <p id="32735cc5-2608-4a3e-be94-f6d452fabe76">In sum, each equities and options exchange is built on its own unique platform, utilizes unique entry protocols and requirements and thus creates uniquely formatted audit trails.</p>
      <p id="9be445e1-7d6b-464e-8f7d-2cda42e8262c">The existence of multiple non-integrated audit trails has direct consequences on the accuracy and efficiency of regulatory oversight. The Commission has stated that:</p>
      <p id="4c863123-8a89-4cf5-bf7f-9020d41de213">&#8230;there are shortcomings in the completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of these existing audit trail systems. Some of these shortcomings are a result of the disparate nature of the systems, which make it impractical, for example, to follow orders through their entire lifecycle as they may be routed, aggregated, re-routed, and disaggregated across multiple markets. The lack of key information in the audit trails that would be useful for regulatory oversight, such as the identity of the customers who originate orders, or even the fact that two sets of orders may have been originated by the same customer, is another shortcoming.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-10" NAME="fr_pz3-10">180</a></p>
      <p id="cdf80860-07b3-4158-b12c-5e7a6eb3a54e">In addition, the Intermarket Surveillance Group&#8217;s (&#8220;ISG&#8221;) consolidated equity audit trail combines transaction data from all exchanges and is used by all Participants for surveillance purposes. However, the ISG audit trail is limited because it contains clearing member and executing broker&#8217;s CRD numbers, but does not contain information about the beneficial owner to a trade. It also does not contain order detail information such as a complete order entry time or routing history.</p>
      <p id="938e7137-182a-4d4f-883b-0f8b6681d425">COATS and the ISG equity audit trails are utilized to generate various option cross market/cross product exception reports, such as front-running and anticipatory hedges. Since the current data is unable to drill down to beneficial owner or order information, these reports are less effective and produce a large number of false positives.</p>
      <p id="53f565e9-33e6-4392-a79e-c9627b28a2d3">(B) Costs, Benefits, and Other Economic Impacts of Audit Trail Reporting on Regulators and Market Participants</p>
      <p id="11ff9dd8-d09d-4d9c-9f9f-a6f060a08732">(1) Participants</p>
      <p id="52b6126d-451a-45c1-beff-2b4dfd723e41">There are 19 Participants of varying sizes that have established audit trail reporting requirements for NMS Securities. Of these, one is a registered securities association. The other 18 Participants are exchanges. Fourteen of these exchanges permit quotation and transactions in NMS Securities and 12 permit transactions and quotations in Listed Options.</p>
      <p id="148dc047-3b2b-4821-a456-3ddf99750423">Participants expend resources currently to maintain and update their audit trail reporting systems. Costs for current surveillance programs as indicated by Participants responding to the Costs to Participants Study vary significantly, reflecting the various sizes of Participants: total annual costs associated with meeting current regulatory requirements are estimated to be $6,900,000. Total annual costs for current surveillance programs for all Participants are $147,200,000.</p>
      <p id="14c92fed-f944-4697-933d-5479e6be626d">(2) Broker-Dealers</p>
      <p id="916b4f41-99c0-45ed-8c86-0b81d986574a">Broker-dealers benefit from the current regime of audit trail reporting to the extent that reporting today permits the Commission and Participants to monitor for rule compliance. Effective regulatory and compliance oversight ensures increased market integrity and supports investor confidence in participating in financial markets. Conversely, if investors believe that regulators are unable to adequately and effectively monitor activities in a complex market (through current audit trail reporting), broker-dealers bear some of the cost in the form of lower market activity.</p>
      <p id="f0847a46-7a82-4da2-a132-908a2b50297d">Broker-dealers that are FINRA members must have systems and processes in place to provide FINRA with the reportable data in the required format. These systems also require resources to ensure that data quality and consistency and timeliness of reporting are maintained, and record-keeping obligations are fulfilled.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-6" NAME="fr_pz4-6">181</a> Additionally, firm trading and order routing systems send orders and quotations to each exchange in the format required by such exchange. In turn, each exchange must store and convert the data for the purposes of creating internal exchange audit trails. Broker-dealers also commit staff to respond to Participant and Commission requests for additional data and related information based upon surveillance.</p>
      <p id="4ca36ed6-ecb6-41e8-b900-d4d96e6ee4ed">Broker-dealers may take varied approaches to fulfilling their regulatory reporting obligations. For instance, many broker-dealers develop internal systems for the purpose of compiling order and trading data into a reportable format. In these instances, the firms may need to centralize varied and disparate systems. Other broker-dealers typically use third parties to help them comply with their reporting obligations. These third parties may include service bureaus that provide the firms with order management systems. Firms may also contract with their clearing firms to package and submit order data files on their behalf.</p>
      <p id="36ffc43a-f679-43fc-9bdb-464352d23659">Some broker-dealers that are FINRA members may be exempt from OATS reporting, or are excluded under FINRA rules from OATS requirements. Exempt firms go through a formal exemption request process through which they certify that they meet the exemption criteria which includes: (1) the member firm has total annual revenue of less than $2,000,000; (2) the member firm and current control affiliates and associated persons of the member have not been subject within the last five years to any final disciplinary action, and within the last 10 years to any disciplinary action involving fraud; (3) the member does not conduct any clearing or carrying activities for other firms; (4) the member does not conduct any market making activities in NMS Stocks and OTC Equity Securities; and (5) the member does not execute principal transactions with its customers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-7" NAME="fr_pz4-7">182</a> FINRA also excludes some members from the definition of a reporting member. The criteria to receive this exclusion include: (1) the member must engage in a non-discretionary order routing process where the firm immediately routes all of its orders to a single receiving reporting member; (2) the member cannot direct or maintain control over subsequent routing or execution by the receiving reporting member; (3) the receiving reporting member must record and report all information under applicable FINRA rules; and (4) the member must have a written agreement with the receiving reporting member specifying the respective functions and responsibilities of each party.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-8" NAME="fr_pz4-8">183</a> Approximately 660 broker-dealers are either exempt or excluded from OATS requirements, but will be required to report to the Central Repository. These broker-dealers are included in the estimate of broker-dealers currently quoting or executing trades in NMS Securities and/or Listed Options.</p>
      <p id="25d3e127-4f51-477d-bde1-6481beb2d4c5">Additionally, the OATS rules do not require that proprietary orders generated in the normal course of market-making be reported.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-9" NAME="fr_pz4-9">184</a> While some firms have chosen to voluntarily report such orders, there may be current gaps in the audit trail.</p>
      <p id="05eb281c-6d3f-4880-9b01-86a4afeccbb3">Broker-dealers that are members of other Participants must also have systems and processes in place to provide the necessary reportable data in the required format. These systems also require resources to ensure data quality and consistency, timeliness of reporting, and record-keeping obligations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-5" NAME="fr_pz5-5">185</a> Broker-dealers that are members of more than one Participant must maintain and manage systems that provide the relevant audit trail data to each Participant for which they have an obligation to report such data, in the manner and by the rules proscribed by each Participant, as applicable.</p>
      <p id="bd033d45-5472-48cc-8ed0-a8f365860077">Upon request, broker-dealers must submit Electronic Blue Sheet (&#8220;EBS&#8221;) data to the requesting Participant by the specified due date, which is generally ten business days after receipt of the initial request. An EBS request is made by product and trade date range, with the data providing detailed information about the underlying accounts that transacted in the requested security. EBS requests can only be made for settled transactions in equity, option, or fixed income products, and they include information on allocations and executions of the requested product and may cover a time period of up to seven years from the date requested. Large Trader Reports are similar to EBS reports, except they are requested only by the Commission. Large trader requests may only be requested for NMS Securities, which may include unsettled transactions. In addition to requests being made by security and trade date range, a Large Trader request may be made by a LTID and trade date range. An LTID is an SEC identifier used to identify related entities under the same beneficial ownership structure. Broker-dealers must have systems and processes in place to provide EBS or large trader reportable data in the required format. These systems require resources to ensure that the data quality and timeliness of reporting are maintained, and record-keeping obligations are met. As with OATS, broker-dealers must commit staff to respond to requests for EBS or large trader data and may take varied approaches to fulfilling their regulatory reporting obligations.</p>

The Participants determined that, as of July 31, 2014, approximately 1,800 of these registered broker-dealers quoted or executed transactions in NMS Securities, Listed Options or OTC Equity Securities. Of these 1,800 broker-dealers, approximately 1,700 are FINRA members and are either reporting to OATS or were identified as routing firms in OATS reports submitted by other OATS reporting broker-dealers, but are otherwise excluded from the definition of an OATS reporting member or exempt from the OATS rules. In addition, there are an estimated 100 broker-dealers that reported transactions to another SRO, but that are not FINRA members. This determination was made through a review of the number of broker-dealers that transmitted order information to OATS, reported transaction information or quoted messages to a Participant for each month, over the previous 18 months. The Participants also reviewed message traffic data in the same month in the prior year and found that July 2014 was a reasonable representation of such activity.</p>

      <p id="8f632c78-19b9-43ab-84cb-3cd3a30ce1b3">In analyzing responses to the Costs to CAT Reporters Study, Participants found responses to specific questions to be outliers. However, if the overall response from that respondent was otherwise deemed to be reasonably complete, the response was included in the analysis. As a result, in some cases, this may result in averages or medians being higher or lower than may be expected. In addition, a significant number of firms, in particular large firms, indicated that their current cost for regulatory obligations is $0. It is the Participants&#8217; understanding that this is likely due to current operational practices among broker-dealers that do not differentiate between technology and headcount costs that support business functionality and regulatory reporting.</p>
      <p id="906c9db2-631b-4264-a9e6-2d01951b6853">Tables 1 and 2 describe the costs associated with current regulatory reporting requirements. Current costs for study respondents consisted of hardware / software costs, FTE costs consisting of development / maintenance, operational, and compliance staffing as well as third party outsourcing costs.

CAT Reporters may currently rely on third-parties to provide key services necessary to meet the reporting obligations. Smaller broker-dealers may rely wholly or in part on third-party providers for the infrastructure to manage and maintain their electronic records, including all of the data required for audit trail reporting. Larger broker-dealers and Participants may augment their own internal IT capacity and capabilities by purchasing the services of one or more third-party vendor. As a result, it is important to understand the current reporting cost as well as the likely impact of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> on these vendors and to include them in the estimate of aggregate economic impacts.</p>

One of the respondents indicated that the vendor did not currently have any reporting expenses on behalf of its clients and did not expect to face any costs under the CAT. Of the remaining responses, three respondents supported more than 100 clients, and one supported between 50 and 99 clients. Two of the respondents supported up to 25 million accounts, and two supported up to 50 million accounts. Two of the respondents serviced clients with institutional and retail businesses, while the remaining two supported clients with institutional businesses only.</p>

      <p id="f7b1a9c6-2eed-411c-9fb4-1c876eb642be">Through the RFP, review of proposals received, and interaction with industry, the Participants have identified the sources of the costs associated with the CAT NMS Plan. These include direct costs associated with creating, implementing and maintaining the CAT necessary to meet the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. There are also direct costs associated with developing and adapting applicable CAT Reporter systems to meet the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan and comply with the Plan on an ongoing basis. Additionally, Participants and broker-dealers may incur direct costs associated with the retirement of redundant reporting systems, although there may also be significant savings to broker-dealers associated with retiring those systems over time.</p>

These costs include staff time contributed by each Participant to, among other things, determine the technological requirements for the Central Repository, develop the RFP, evaluate Bids received, design and collect the data necessary to evaluate costs and other economic impacts, meet with Industry Members to solicit feedback, and complete the CAT NMS Plan submitted to the Commission for consideration. The Participants estimate that they have collectively contributed 20 FTEs in the first 30 months of the CAT NMS Plan development process. In addition, the Participants have incurred public relations, legal, and consulting costs in the preparation of the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants estimate the costs of these services to be $8,800,000. These public relations, legal, and consulting costs are considered reasonably associated with creating, implementing, and maintaining the CAT upon the Commission&#8217;s adoption of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

      <p id="6de6e7d7-2991-47f6-9e0f-3d65a09e2a81">Investors benefit from the protections provided through the use of audit trail data, permitting regulators to adequately and effectively monitor activities in today&#8217;s complex securities markets. In <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, the Commission identified several ways that the CAT would enhance the protections to investors. These include: facilitating risk-based examinations, better identification of potentially manipulative trading activity, improved processes for evaluating tips, complaints and referrals of potential misconduct made to regulators, increased efficiency of cross-market and principal order surveillance, improved analysis and reconstruction of broad-based market events, improved ability to monitor and evaluate changes to market structure, and efficiencies from a potential reduction in disparate reporting requirements and data requests.</p>
      <p id="c952ed05-de57-4769-921e-216d0fa4d8f9">For instance, as shown in academic literature, surveillance has been demonstrated to increase investor confidence, by mitigating manipulative behavior and increasing trading activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-5" NAME="fr_pz13-5">197</a> Academic literature provides support for the notion that investors associate enhanced surveillance with greater investment opportunity across a larger number of listed companies and with higher market capitalizations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-6" NAME="fr_pz13-6">198</a> Cross-market surveillance &#8211; an opportunity expected to be improved by CAT &#8211; is likely more effective in detecting manipulative behavior than single-market surveillance. A more recent study provides evidence that better surveillance is associated with reduced insider trading, as it would be harder to hide such trades.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-7" NAME="fr_pz13-7">199</a></p>
      <p id="f56a5b52-b1af-4d47-88ef-e8a150101971">To the extent that better surveillance leads to more effective rulemaking,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-8" NAME="fr_pz13-8">200</a> investors should also benefit from the improvements in market quality that might arise from such rulemaking. For example, one study shows that detailed trading rules are positively correlated with liquidity measures evidenced by lower volatility and bid-ask spreads.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-9" NAME="fr_pz13-9">201</a> Similarly, a separate study finds that European Union countries that have more effective rules to prevent market abuse and enhance transparency experience higher market liquidity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-10" NAME="fr_pz13-10">202</a></p>
      <p id="d9b4079d-6cdb-40af-8464-3afcb06c32d1">Investors may also bear the costs associated with maintaining and enhancing the current audit trail systems. In some cases, broker-dealers may pass on regulatory charges that support Participant supervision, such as with respect to Section 31 fees.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-11" NAME="fr_pz13-11">203</a> In other cases, broker-dealers may cover some of their regulatory charges through commissions and other charges. Similarly, broker-dealers may seek to pass on to investors their costs to build and maintain the CAT, which may include their own costs and any costs passed on to them by Participants. This analysis does not measure either the likelihood of these costs being passed through to investors nor the potential dollar impact on investors. The extent to which these costs are passed on to investors depends on the materiality of the costs and the ease with which investors can substitute away from any given broker-dealer.</p>

      <p id="c0861bfa-2f46-4538-955c-6fe406b51924">Participants are expected to benefit from the requirements to report to the Central Repository. To the extent that the CAT enhances comparability of audit trail data &#8211; thereby enhancing order lifecycle comparability across different trading venues &#8211; Participants may better fulfill their obligations to &#8220;prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities&#8221; as set forth in <a href="">Section 6 of the Exchange Act</a>.</p>
      <p id="57af98ec-1639-48d3-a481-45019ae1f55e">Participants would also incur direct costs associated with creating, implementing and maintaining the CAT infrastructure. The full cost associated with the build and maintenance of the CAT would be shared among Participants and Industry Members, consistent with the CAT NMS Plan. Participants would also be subject to costs associated with updating and maintaining their own systems to comply with their obligations to report to the Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="bd7a356b-04b6-4c4d-9e0d-ece9b0bbf796">(1) Central Repository Build and Maintenance Costs</p>
      <p id="8f85820a-5985-4765-946f-d972cd919c6d">The CAT NMS Plan provides that the costs arising from the build and maintenance of the CAT will be collected from all CAT Reporters, which includes Participants.

      <p id="61634cb3-3bde-4d73-9354-f5aee4063874">The CAT NMS Plan also contemplates that Participants may impose greater requirements on the Central Repository based on their use of information in the repository for regulatory purposes. These requirements may take the form of frequent and complex analyses of data which may likely require more resources from the Central Repository. It is critical that the Company recover its costs in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in the CAT NMS Plan, which include both the need to allocate costs in a manner consistent with the cost to operations and that the CAT NMS Plan not create significant disincentives to Participants in seeking to meet their regulatory obligations. As such, the CAT NMS Plan permits the Company to assess additional charges to Participants associated with their use of the Central Repository&#8217;s data and reporting facilities as it deems necessary.</p>

The Costs to Participants Study was designed to provide insight into the current total costs associated with regulatory reporting and surveillance programs discussed above, as well as expected implementation and maintenance costs associated with reporting to and surveillance through the Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="e696be3a-c799-4cb5-92d5-e4eba17a19a5">The anticipated costs associated with the implementation of regulatory reporting to the Central Repository were estimated to be a total of $17,900,000 across all ten Participants. Included in this cost, Participants reported a total of $770,000 in legal and consulting costs, as well as total FTE costs of $10,300,000 for operational, technical/development and compliance-type functions.</p>
      <p id="7d079bf2-e7d6-4cad-820c-cb5c0ee75561">Maintenance costs associated with regulatory reporting to Central Repository were estimated to be a total of $14,700,000 across all ten Participants. Included in this estimate are legal, consulting, and other costs associated with maintenance, a total of $720,000, and $7,300,000 to FTEs for operational, technical/development, and compliance functions regarding the maintenance of regulatory reporting associated with CAT.</p>
      <p id="7c2d5f8e-0b0f-41ac-9a34-f8e102a3e4fa">The Participants were also asked to identify the costs associated with the implementation of surveillance programs within the Central Repository. The estimated total costs across all ten Participants were $23,200,000 including estimated legal, consulting, and other costs of $560,000. Also included in the total, Participants reported that they would allocate a total of $17,500,000 to FTEs to operational, technical/development, and compliance staff to be engaged in the creation of surveillance programs.</p>
      <p id="17549ef7-0b64-40f9-b98e-48b74cb8909e">The estimated total costs associated with the maintenance of surveillance programs were $87,700,000, including $1,000,000 for legal, consulting, and other costs. Of the total cost, the Participants estimated that they would allocate a total of $66,700,000 to FTEs to operational, technical/development and compliance staff.</p>
      <p id="d00ad904-13ef-4521-af1b-f623210ebd4d">Retirement costs for current systems were estimated to be $310,000 across all Participants. However, Participants expect that by no longer needing to maintain these legacy systems due to adoption of the CAT, they will realize aggregate savings of $10,600,000, which will partially offset some of the costs expected to be borne by the Participants as described further below. To the extent that the Participants are able to retire legacy systems and replace them with more efficient and cost effective technologies, they may experience additional cost savings. The Costs to Participants Study does not attempt to quantify any such additional cost savings to broker-dealers.</p>

      <p id="b9ca80b8-ee26-4d96-b964-7fec36f8a487">The CAT is expected to provide a more resilient audit trail system that may benefit broker-dealers. For instance, as noted above, more effective oversight of market activity may increase investor confidence and help expand the investment opportunity set through increased listings. Broker-dealers may benefit from increased investor confidence, provided that it results in increased trading activity. In addition, broker-dealers may experience less burden, to the extent that, data provided to the Central Repository reduces the number of direct requests by regulators for their surveillance, examination and enforcement programs. For example, after the implementation of CAT, regulators seeking to identify activity for NMS Securities at the customer account level, would access that information from the Central Repository, rather than making a Blue Sheet request.</p>
      <p id="4076de90-d82d-4e7c-ae4e-81b3cbbe4beb">More broadly, one benefit identified to broker-dealers of the CAT may arise from consolidating the collection and transmission of audit trail data into a uniform activity, regardless of where the quoting and trading occur. Such a consolidation may permit some broker-dealers to reduce the number of systems they operate to provide audit trail data to Participants and to retire legacy systems, at an appropriate time. Additionally, technological advances may make the operation of the new CAT Systems more efficient than those associated with the legacy systems. The Costs to CAT Reporters Study did not attempt to quantify any such cost savings to firms, an as such, the cost estimates provided here do not include consideration that such cost savings may be low.</p>

From a maintenance perspective, large firms estimated that it would cost $3,662,000 for Approach 1 versus $3,148,000 for Approach 2, a cost difference of $514,000. Small firms also indicated that Approach 1 would be more expensive to implement and maintain than Approach 2. Small firms indicated that it would cost $551,200 to implement Approach 1 versus $475,600 for Approach 2, indicating a cost difference of $90,200. For the maintenance phases, small firms estimated it would cost approximately $475,600 for Approach 1 maintenance, versus $441,500 for Approach 2 maintenance, a cost difference of $34,100 between approaches.

      <p id="8467dcf4-89de-47e0-b316-a50177fcf057">In comparing the two approaches and their costs to the current costs incurred by a broker-dealer for current regulatory reporting, respondents have indicated that they estimate both Approach 1 and Approach 2 to be less expensive than current regulatory reporting requirements. Overall, firms estimated that current costs would be $4,290,000 for large firms versus $1,210,000 for small firms, while maintenance costs of Approach 1 for large firms would cost $3,662,000 and $475,600 for small firms, indicating cost savings of $628,000 for large firms and cost savings of $734,400 for small firms. For maintenance costs related to Approach 2, large firms indicated costs of $3,148,000 with an expected savings of $1,142,000 while small firms estimated maintenance costs of $441,500 with expected savings of $768,500.</p>
      <p id="5765f01c-759b-4380-bb14-1601bfc8bb98">Although there are differences in the current and anticipated maintenance costs discussed above, the Participants conclude that there would be no statistical difference in costs associated with the maintenance of the CAT, compared to maintenance costs for existing regulatory reporting requirements. Participants arrive at this conclusion on the basis of a standard t-test of the hypothesis that the difference in costs to broker-dealers between Approach 1 and Approach 2 is different from zero. The t-test is unable to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., that the difference in costs between the two approaches is not distinguishable from zero) at the 0.05% level separately for estimates of hardware / software costs, FTE costs, vendor costs, and total costs across large OATS reporters, small OATS reporters, large non-OATS reporters, and small non-OATS reporters.</p>

      <p id="54fa3e33-1c0d-4780-9806-8397ff3e457e">Participants&#8217; understanding of broker-dealer costs has been enhanced through frequent dialogue with Industry Members. The DAG has largely provided written feedback on costs through the industry association members. In March 2013, SIFMA provided feedback on industry costs in its Consolidated Audit Trail White Paper.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-7" NAME="fr_pz33-7">206</a> The association group stated that the industry is likely to face costs related to upgrading the regulatory reporting infrastructure. SIFMA highlighted that additional costs borne will be distributed across the front office, middle office, customer master data, compliance and risk and data management. Additionally, in February 2012, the FIF conducted a study to assess the costs associated with the implementation of OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-8" NAME="fr_pz33-8">207</a> In a summary of the study, FIF highlights that &#8220;future estimates of cost should consider the FIF cost model, most importantly the effort expended on business analysis and testing as part of the implementation effort.&#8221; One key view presented by the DAG was that retiring legacy systems will likely reduce costs to the industry, given their redundancies with the CAT. However, the FIF highlighted that existing timelines do not take into account costs associated with concurrent reporting for existing regulatory reporting and new regulatory requirements associated with the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-9" NAME="fr_pz33-9">208</a> Additional detail around the plan to retire existing regulatory reports can be found in Appendix C, Section C.9.</p>

      <p id="ef5f1e59-10e3-46e4-bf9b-87f8df4cb5f5">The Costs to Vendors Study requested information regarding various third party service provider and vendor costs to comply with the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>.</p>
      <p id="852e43d6-cc85-41cd-be82-c215b35482c3">Based upon the responses to the Costs to Vendors Study, the expected dollar costs for implementation and maintenance of the CAT are largely the same for both approaches, and ranged widely between $0 and $20,000,000 for implementation and $50,000 and $6,000,000 for ongoing maintenance. One firm did indicate that Approach 1 would have substantially higher maintenance costs ($400,000 for Approach 1 versus $50,000 for Approach 2). For headcount and costs associated with implementation and maintenance of the CAT, all respondents indicated that Approach 1 would require more FTE resources (costs) to implement (ranging from 14 ($9,600,000) to 170 ($35,900,000) FTEs for Approach 1 and from 4 ($2,700,000) to 45 ($24,200,000) for Approach 2), while Approach 2 would require more FTE resources to maintain (ranging from 4.5 ($4,100,000) to 35 ($9,300,000) for Approach 1 and from 2 ($2,500,000) to 56 ($11,200,000) for Approach 2). As with current regulatory reporting costs, the firm with the largest number of clients reported the highest costs, but number of clients did not always correlate uniformly with higher expected costs for the other firms.</p>
      <p id="067fd212-5fae-4abd-a5d3-26d8b61b6eaf">Three of the four respondents to the vendor study indicated that they would incur costs to retire current regulatory reporting systems, with costs ranging from $500,000 to $5,000,000, with the firm with the highest expected retirement costs also having the highest current reporting costs. FTE requirements ranged from 1.5 ($250,000) to 23 ($7,200,000) FTEs.</p>
      <p id="402c0813-3a89-46b8-b0de-9cfb7983920f">Under Approach 1, two respondents expected ongoing maintenance to cost less than the maintenance of current regulatory reporting requirements, with the remaining two expecting higher costs. Under Approach 2, two respondents expected ongoing maintenance to cost less than the maintenance of current regulatory reporting requirements, one expected costs to be the same, and the final firm expected costs to be greater. All firms expected headcount associated with ongoing maintenance of the CAT to be less than under current reporting requirements.</p>

      <p id="8548c06f-3a4b-48fe-8a4f-253cdd8b011c">Issuers also benefit from an effective regulatory regime supported by a reliable and complete audit trail. Specifically, issuers may benefit from enhanced investor confidence associated with better and more efficient oversight. The increase in investor confidence may draw more investors into the market, relative to other investment opportunities that do not provide the same protections. Increasing the pool of investors willing to invest in a primary offering may manifest itself in a lower cost of capital. Increased investor participation in secondary trading may also increase demand in the primary market, as the increased interest would be associated with greater efficiency in pricing and lower adverse selection costs. To the extent that the issuers do not have independent reporting obligations to the Central Repository (i.e., they are not otherwise CAT Reporters), they are not anticipated to incur direct costs associated with the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="6457ce1c-9e3a-4da2-81fe-e0d30b976fa0">(F) Indirect Costs</p>
      <p id="f07c2182-8ba8-46d0-ad13-e02b5fed759a">The Participants recognize that in addition to direct costs, there may be indirect costs borne by parties as a result of the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan. As discussed further below, it is not possible for the Participants to quantify these costs, and as such, we present a qualitative discussion.</p>
      <p id="ea2fc80a-dc88-4583-96b3-3882ef6b2257">The Participants have identified at least three distinct ways for indirect costs to arise as a result of the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan. First, all CAT Reporters are subject to direct fees to pay for the creation, implementation, and maintenance of the CAT along with other direct costs to meet CAT NMS Plan obligations. CAT Reporters may endeavor to shift these fees and other costs to their clients. Where CAT Reporters can do so successfully, the clients bear an indirect cost arising from the CAT NMS Plan. Second, to the extent that the Commission and the Participants amend their surveillance programs in the presence of the Central Repository, the broker-dealers may incur costs to adjust their internal compliance programs. And third, as described more fully in Appendix C, Analysis of the Impact on Competition, Efficiency and Capital Formation, broker-dealer competition may be impacted if the direct and indirect costs associated with meeting the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s requirements materially impact the provision of their services to the public. Such a reduction in the provision of these services may impose an indirect cost on the public as well.</p>
      <p id="817d5971-4f0a-4e1c-b186-469b204e9cf9">The Participants considered the potential for CAT Reporters to shift fees and other costs associated with the CAT NMS Plan. Participants may charge their members to cover the CAT NMS Plan costs either explicitly or subsume those costs in other fees or assessments. Broker-dealers may charge their clients for their own costs, whether incurred directly or indirectly, either through explicit fees associated with CAT or through their existing fee structures. This analysis does not measure either the likelihood of costs being passed from the Participant to the broker-dealers or from the broker-dealers to their clients, or the potential associated dollar impacts. The extent to which these costs may be passed on to clients is related to alternative sources of revenue available to the CAT Reporters, the materiality of those costs, and the ease with which clients can substitute away from any given Participant or broker-dealer. Participants note, however, that Participants and broker-dealers may currently have incentives and opportunity to shift regulatory compliance costs to their customers and that nothing in the CAT NMS Plan alters those incentives or the likelihood of those costs being passed on.</p>
      <p id="15f6ce08-2b01-40c7-aa72-33fcaccab608">In addition, indirect costs to broker-dealers may arise as a result of the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan. First, broker-dealers may incur additional costs related to training and professional development, to equip the staff with the necessary knowledge necessary for compliance with the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. Broker-dealers were specifically asked to consider these costs as part of their study response. Second, the enhanced and standardized data to be captured by the Central Repository is anticipated to increase the effectiveness of surveillance by regulators, which may impact broker-dealer compliance programs.</p>

CAT Reporters, including Participants and broker-dealers engaging in trading and quoting activities in Eligible Securities, will be jointly responsible for providing the capital to build and maintain the CAT. Costs eligible to be allocated jointly include any associated liabilities accrued during the planning and building phases of the project that are directly attributable to the CAT NMS Plan, for example, legal and consulting fees, and will be allocated according to the funding model described in Article XI of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

For implementation costs associated with the Plan Processor, the Participants reviewed the build costs received from the Shortlisted Bidders and identified the high and low costs to use as a component of the overall industry cost. The lowest cost received was $30,000,000 and the highest estimate received was $91,600,000.</p>
      <p id="43460d36-0223-4319-ab3f-fc717b4b8f25">Maintenance Costs. For maintenance costs associated with the Plan Processor, the Participants also reviewed the cost schedules received from the Shortlisted Bidders to build the range. To define the range of maintenance costs, the Participants reviewed the peak year maintenance costs from the Shortlisted Bidders. In addition to the costs received from the Shortlisted Bidders associated with the maintenance of operating and running the CAT, the Participants also included a yearly technical upgrade estimate to conservatively take into account changes in technology that may take place during the maintenance of the CAT. These additional costs begin at approximately 20% in year one, and slowly decrease to 5% during year five of operation. As such, the annual maintenance costs are estimated to range from $35,200,000 to $134,900,000.</p>

      <p id="6bb22d54-fa09-4fa3-8823-4204d7113911">Implementation and maintenance costs related to the CAT for broker-dealers were extrapolated from the results of the Costs to CAT Reporters Study. As described above, the Participants believe there to be approximately 1,800 broker-dealers that would be CAT Reporters. Of the 167 respondents to the Costs to CAT Reporters Study, 49 were large firms, and 118 were small firms, indicating a large to small firm ratio in the overall population of 29% to 71%. Applying this ratio to the total population of 1,800 broker-dealers, results in 522 large firms and 1,278 small firms. In comparing the costs between the two approaches, the Participants have identified that Approach 1 is more expensive than the Approach 2, which causes Approach 1 to form the upper bound of the broker-dealer cost range, and Approach 2 to form the lower bound of the broker-dealer cost range.</p>

The Participants requested that the Commission provide the Participants with an exemption so that only options exchanges would record and report details for each options market maker quote and related Reportable Event to the Central Repository, while options market makers would be relieved of their obligation to record and report their quotes and related Reportable Events to the Central Repository. The Participants estimated that having both parties report options market maker quotes to the CAT would impose significant costs on the Plan Processor due to increased data storage and technical infrastructure, and on the options market makers due to a higher volume of reporting obligations. The Participants estimated that having both parties report options market maker quotes to the CAT would increase the size of data submitted to the CAT by approximately 18 billion records each day. Bidders estimated that requiring dual reporting of options market maker quotes would, over a five year period, lead to additional costs of between $2 million and $16 million for data storage and technical infrastructure for the Plan Processor. In addition, according to the results of a cost study conducted by three industry associations,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-5" NAME="fr_pz39-5">217</a> the cost to options market makers to meet their quote reporting obligations ranges from $307 million to $382 million over a five year period.</p>

The Commission noted that including a unique customer identifier could enhance the efficiency of surveillance and regulatory oversight. The Participants, however, favor the Customer Information Approach, that would require broker-dealers to provide detailed account and Customer information to the CAT, and have the Plan Processor correlate the Customer information across broker-dealers, assign a unique Customer identifier to each Customer and use that unique Customer identifier consistently across all CAT Data. The Participants believe that the Customer-ID approach imposes a significant cost burden on market participants and on the Plan Processor. According to cost estimates provided by the DAG,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A9Gl" NAME="fr_A9Gl">218</a> the cost for the top 250 CAT reporters to implement the Customer-ID as required in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> would be at least $195 million. The Participants believe that this cost estimate is conservative, since it only represents the cost estimate for 11% of the total broker-dealers that are expected to be CAT Reporters.</p>
      <p id="dbc8bc8a-93c6-4f11-a0e0-4367fe8ec412">Third, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(c)(7)</a> requires that a CAT-Reporter-ID be reported to the Central Repository for each order and Reportable Event, so that regulators can determine which market participant took action with respect to an order at each Reportable Event. The Participants, however, have proposed to leverage existing business practices and identifiers (&#8220;Existing Identifier Approach&#8221;), rather than requiring new identifiers be established, as the former is deemed more efficient and cost-effective in implementing the CAT-Reporter-ID. The Participants believe that the CAT-Reporter-ID approach would impose a material cost burden on broker-dealers and Participants, as compared to the Existing Identifier Approach, since it would require major changes to broker-dealer systems. According to cost estimates provided by the DAG, the cost for the 250 largest CAT Reporters to implement the CAT-Reporter-ID as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> would be $78 million.</p>

The Participants acknowledge that this information is useful to regulators to fulfill their obligations to protect investors. However, the Participants estimate that meeting the obligations of the Rule would be unduly burdensome and costly to achieve given the existing allocation practices. As an alternative, the Participants proposed that allocations will be reported by CAT Reporters via a tool described as an Allocation Report. To create linkages from the order execution to the allocation process by means of an order identifier, the broker-dealers would be required to perform extensive re-engineering of their front, middle, and back office systems, and thus incur significant costs. According to cost estimates provided by the DAG, the cost for the 250 largest CAT Reporters to link allocations to executions would be $525 million.</p>

The Participants understand that time stamp granularity to the millisecond reflects current industry standards with respect to electronically-processed events in the order lifecycle. However, due to the lack of precision, the industry practice with respect to manual orders is to capture manual time stamps with granularity at the level of one second. The Participants believe that compliance with the time stamp granularity requirements of the Plan for Manual Order Events would result in added costs to the industry as there may be a need to upgrade databases, internal messaging applications/ protocols, data warehouses, and reporting applications to enable the reporting of such time stamps to the Central Repository. The Participants estimate that the total minimum cost to the industry to comply with a singular time stamp requirement for all CAT reporting would be approximately $10.5 million. This estimate is based on a current cost of $1,050 per manual timestamp clock which stamps to the second, with approximately 10,000 clocks requiring replacement across the industry. Upgrading this to millisecond granularity would likely add to the cost to the industry.</p>

      <p id="c5f7bc22-b99a-494c-b81a-6eed0f9a9a4e">Article XI of the CAT NMS Plan provides the process for determining the funding of the Company. In general, the Participants&#8217; approach to funding of the Company is: (A) to operate the Company on a break-even basis, which means having fees imposed and collected that cover the Company&#8217;s costs and an appropriate reserve; and (B) to establish a fee structure that is equitable based on funding principles.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-6" NAME="fr_pz40-6">219</a> Such equitable funding principles include: (1) to create transparent, predictable revenue streams aligned with anticipated costs; (2) to allocate costs among Participants and Industry Members taking into account the timeline for implementation of the CAT and the distinctions in the securities trading operations of Participants and Industry Members and their impact on the Company&#8217;s resources and operations; (3) to establish a tiered fee structure in which there is general comparability in the level of fees charged to CAT Reporters with the most CAT-related activity as measured by market share for Execution Venues, including ATSs, and by message traffic for non-ATS activities of Industry Members, where, for these comparability purposes, the tiered fee structure takes into consideration affiliations between or among CAT Reporters, whether Execution Venues and/or Industry Members; (4) to provide ease of administrative functions; (5) to avoid disincentives such as burdens on competition and reduction in market quality; and (6) to build financial stability for the Company as a going concern.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-7" NAME="fr_pz40-7">220</a></p>
      <p id="c7b2c313-4983-4fac-bd48-5f78318fe417">Based on these principles, the Operating Committee will establish the Company&#8217;s funding, which is expected to arise primarily from fees charged to Participants and Industry Members. The Participants have sought input from the DAG as to the specific types of fees. Accordingly, the Participants propose to include the following fee types: (i) fixed fees payable by each Execution Venue that trades NMS Securities and OTC Equity Securities based on its market share (establishing two to five tiers of fixed fees); (ii) fixed fees payable by each Execution Venue that trades Listed Options (as defined in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 600(b)(35) of Regulation NMS</a>) based on its market share (establishing two to five tiers of fixed fees); (iii) fixed fees payable by each Industry Member based on message traffic generated by such Industry Member (for the avoidance of doubt, the fixed fees payable by Industry Members pursuant to this paragraph shall, in addition to any other applicable message traffic, include message traffic generated by: (i) an ATS that does not execute orders that is sponsored by such Industry Member; (ii) routing orders to and from any ATS sponsored by such Industry Member); and (iii) ancillary fees (e.g., fees for late or inaccurate reporting, corrections, and access and use of the CAT for regulatory and oversight purposes).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-4" NAME="fr_pz41-4">221</a></p>
      <p id="0603231e-c956-4bb9-88a0-48b12db2ed6f">The Operating Committee will use two different criteria to establish fees &#8211; market share<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-5" NAME="fr_pz41-5">222</a> for Execution Venues, including ATSs, and message traffic for Industry Members&#8217; non-ATS activities &#8211; due to the fundamental differences between the two types of entities. While there are multiple factors that contribute to the cost of building, maintaining and using the CAT, Bidders stated during workshops and in response to specific questions posed by the Participants that processing and storage of incoming message traffic is one of the most significant cost drivers for the CAT. Thus, the Participants believe that basing fees on message traffic for non-Execution Venue Industry Members is consistent with an equitable allocation of the costs of the CAT. On the other hand, message traffic would not provide the same degree of differentiation between Participants that it does for Industry Members. Because the majority of message traffic at the Participants consists of quotations, and Participants usually disseminate quotations in all instruments they trade, regardless of execution volume, Execution Venues that are Participants generally disseminate similar amounts of message traffic. In contrast, execution volume more accurately delineates the different levels of trading activity of the Participants. For these reasons, the Participants believe that market share is the appropriate metric to use in establishing fees for Participants. Moreover, given the similarity between the activity of exchange Participants and ATSs, both of which meet the definition of an &#8220;exchange&#8221; as set forth in the Exchange Act, the Participants believe that ATSs should be treated in the same manner as the exchange Participants for the purposes of determining the level of fees associated with the CAT.</p>
      <p id="9d218bd2-80e1-41de-a6ff-c8ab63a2423d">Costs are allocated across the different types of CAT Reporters (broker-dealers, Execution Venues) on a tiered basis, in order to equitably allocate costs to those CAT Reporters that contribute more to the costs of creating, implementing and maintaining the CAT. The fees to be assessed at each tier are calculated so as to recoup a proportion of costs appropriate to the message traffic from firms in each tier. Therefore, larger broker-dealers, generating the majority of message traffic, will be in the higher tiers, and therefore be charged a higher fee. Smaller broker-dealers with low levels of message traffic will be in lower tiers and will be assessed a minimal fee for the CAT. The Participants estimate that up to 75% of broker-dealers will be in the lower tiers of the Funding Model.</p>

      <p id="e58c6dd2-d6dc-45d3-9233-39f3b8a2702e">The CAT NMS Plan contemplates that the Plan Processor will be responsible for developing and executing administrative processes and procedures to effectuate the smooth functioning of the CAT, consistent with the principles articulated in Article XI. These processes and procedures would include, but are not limited to, establishing budget, notice, billing and collection cycles that provide transparency, predictability and ease of administrative functions to CAT reporters. Criteria and schedules for ancillary fees that might be collected pursuant to Article XI are also anticipated to be published by the Operating Committee.</p>
      <p id="08aecf9b-3639-403f-898e-fbf76b923260">In articulating the funding principles of the CAT NMS Plan, Participants have established the need for the CAT NMS Plan to, among other things: (1) create transparent, predictable revenue streams for the Company that are aligned with the anticipated costs to build, operate, and administer the CAT and the other costs of the Company; and (2) provide for ease of billing and other administrative functions. The funding principles articulated in Article XI should also inform the policies and procedures adopted by the Operating Committee in executing the associated functions. To that end, to promote fairness and transparency with respect to fees, the Participants expect that the Operating Committee will adopt policies, procedures, and practices around budgeting, assignment of tiers, adjudicating disputes, billing, and collection of fees that provide appropriate transparency to all CAT Reporters. Participants expect that policies or procedures adopted to implement the administration of fee allocation and collection among CAT Reporters would be subject to comment by impacted parties before adoption.</p>

As part of the development of the CAT NMS Plan, the Participants considered a variety of alternatives with respect to technical and user support considerations. The technical considerations include: primary storage, data ingestion format, development process, quality assurance staffing and user support staffing. The analysis presented in Appendix C, D.12, below, describes alternative approaches considered for each technical consideration and the ultimate choice of the CAT NMS Plan based on factors that consider feasibility, cost and efficiency.</p>
      <p id="13b42883-828e-44cd-90cb-5f1734a88e6e">In addition, the questions included in the Costs to CAT Reporters Study described above permitted the Participants to evaluate cost considerations to Industry Members associated with two different technical formats for reporting audit trail data to the Central Repository. One approach might permit broker-dealers to submit information data to the Central Repository using their choice among existing industry protocols, such as FIX. The second approach provided a scenario where CAT Reporters would submit relevant data to the Central Repository using a defined or specified format, such as an augmented version of OATS.</p>
      <p id="5134ea97-269c-4268-8407-8483115a5d5b">(B) Funding Model</p>
      <p id="ddfb5801-a846-4acb-bcf4-f538efc45802">As discussed above, <a href="#0243422d-8fa8-4e94-a7b8-e5a00052e028">Article XI of the CAT NMS Plan</a> sets forth the provisions for establishing the funding of the Company and recovering the costs of operating the CAT. The Participants recognize that there are a number of different approaches to funding the CAT and have considered a variety of different funding and cost allocation models. Each model has its potential advantages and disadvantages. For example, a structure in which all CAT Reporters are charged a fixed fee regardless of reportable activity would provide CAT Reporters greater certainty regarding their fee obligations, but may place undue burden on small CAT Reporters. A variable fee structure focused on specific reportable information may make it easier for Industry Members to pass fees to their customers. However, such fees would be more complex and difficult to administer. Participants were particularly sensitive to the possibility that the fee structure might create distortions to the economic activities of CAT Reporters if not set appropriately.</p>
      <p id="aad514da-44cf-4da6-97f5-2c246e364e57">The Participants considered alternatives to cost allocation ranging from a strict pro-rata distribution, regardless of the type or size of the CAT Reporters, to a distribution based purely on CAT Reporter activity. Participants also considered a variety of ways to measure activity, including notional value of trading (as currently used for purposes of <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section78ee&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">Section 31 fees</a>), number of trades or quotations, and all message traffic sent. Further, Participants considered the comparability of audit trail activity across different Eligible Securities. The Participants discussed the potential approaches to funding, including the principles articulated in <a href="#0243422d-8fa8-4e94-a7b8-e5a00052e028">Article XI</a> and an illustrative funding model, with the DAG multiple times, beginning on September 3, 2014.</p>
      <p id="f88a4435-747a-4ad3-808e-dfc048e5e04f">After extensive analysis and taking into consideration feedback from the DAG, the Participants determined that a tiered fixed fee structure would be fair and relatively uncomplicated. The Participants discussed several approaches to developing a tiered model, including defining fee tiers based on such factors as size of firm, message traffic or trading dollar volume. For example, a review of OATS data for a recent month shows the wide range in activity among broker-dealers, with a number of broker-dealers submitting fewer than 1,000 orders for the month and other broker-dealers submitting millions and even billions of orders in the same period. The Participants also considered a tiered model where CAT Reporters would be charged different variable fees based on tier assignment. However, the Participants believe a tiered fixed fee model is preferable to a variable model because a variable model would lack the transparency, predictability, and ease of calculation afforded by fixed fees. Such factors are crucial to estimating a reliable revenue stream for the Company and to permitting CAT Reporters to reasonably predict their obligations. Moreover, the Participants believe that the tiered approach would help ensure that fees are equitably allocated among similarly situated CAT Reporters and would further the goal of the Participants to lessen the impact on smaller firms. Irrespective of the approach taken with fees, the Participants believe that revenues generated should be aligned to the costs of building, implementing and maintaining the CAT, and if revenues collected are in excess of costs for any given year, such excess should be considered in setting fees for the following year.</p>
      <p id="7748ddcd-4ff4-4324-bfbe-93ce71254a59">Finally, the Participants believe that it is important to establish a simple fee structure that is easy to understand and administer. The Participants are committed to establishing and billing fees so that Industry Members will have certainty and the ability to budget for them. In that regard, the CAT NMS Plan expressly provides that the Operating Committee shall not make any changes to any fees on more than a semi-annual basis unless, pursuant to a Supermajority Vote, the Operating Committee concludes that such change is necessary for the adequate funding of the Company.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-8" NAME="fr_pz44-8">227</a></p>

In recognition of the complexity of this analysis, the Participants have evaluated a variety of sources of information to assist in the analysis of the impact of the CAT NMS Plan on competition, efficiency and capital formation. Specifically, the Participants have evaluated the many comments related to competition, efficiency and capital formation received in response to the Commission&#8217;s proposal of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> and during the CAT NMS Plan development process. In addition, the Participants considered the input of the DAG. Finally, the Participants used information derived from three cost studies described in the prior section on costs. Based on a review and analysis of these materials, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan, as submitted, is justified given its estimated impacts on competition, efficiency and capital formation.</p>
      <p id="0eb967e8-ee93-4ac3-a3e8-09d8b412874f">(a) Impact on Competition</p>
      <p id="08c81258-7192-4251-a936-03ca0425dc35">Through an analysis of the data and information described above, the Participants have evaluated the potential impact of the CAT NMS Plan on competition, including the competitive impact on the market generally and the competitive impact on each type of Person playing a role in the market (e.g., Participants, broker-dealers, vendors, investors). Potential negative impacts on competition could arise if the CAT NMS Plan were to burden a group or class of CAT Reporters in a way that would harm the public&#8217;s ability to access their services, either through increasing costs or decreased provision of those services. These impacts may be direct, as in the provision of brokerage services to individual investors, or indirect, as in the aggregate costs of managing, trading and maintaining a securities holding. These impacts should be measured relative to the economic baseline, described above.</p>
      <p id="7e18a837-71b3-4e82-8bd5-dd4ac1b0b7ab">The Participants have identified a series of potential impacts on competition that may arise as a result of the terms and conditions of the CAT NMS Plan. These potential impacts may be related to: (1) the technology ultimately used by the CAT and differences across CAT Reporters in their efforts necessary to meet the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s requirements; (2) the method of cost allocation across CAT Reporters; and (3) changes in regulatory reporting requirements, and their attendant costs, particularly to smaller entities, who may previously have benefited from regulatory exemptions.</p>
      <p id="cba52d43-78bb-4da8-9c0a-ad26b27f02c7">In general, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan will avoid disincentives such as placing an inappropriate burden on competition in the U.S. securities markets. The discussion below focuses on competition in the Participant and broker-dealer communities, where the Participants believe there is the greatest potential for impact on competition.</p>
      <p id="e6f6378b-cc5e-48ad-badb-fd6f7047477b">(i) Participants</p>
      <p id="0ba33629-56a5-4f4e-8eb4-4ad74582b5c9">The Participants already incur significant costs to maintain and surveil an audit trail of activity for which they are responsible. Each Participant bears these costs whether it expends internal resources to monitor relevant activity itself, or whether it contracts with others to perform these services on its behalf. The CAT NMS Plan, through the funding principles it sets forth in <a href="#7b03ff34-83c2-477b-adfa-c6155a939d7b">Section 11.2</a>, seeks to distribute the regulatory costs associated with the development and maintenance of a meaningful and comprehensive audit trail in a principled manner. By calibrating the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s funding according to these principles, the Participants sought to avoid placing undue burden on exchanges relative to their core characteristics, including market share and volume of message traffic. Thus, the Participants do not believe that any particular exchange in either the equities or options markets would be placed at a competitive disadvantage in a way that would materially impact the respective Execution Venue marketplaces for either type of security.</p>
      <p id="893c183e-7ec5-4891-9290-4b472f0c541e">In addition, because the CAT NMS Plan seeks to allocate costs in a manner consistent with the Participants&#8217; activities, the Participants do not believe that it would discourage potential new entrants. For instance, an equity ATS &#8211; which would already incur costs under the CAT NMS Plan as a reporting broker-dealer &#8211; should not be discouraged from becoming a national securities exchanges because of the costs it would incur as a Participant based on its business model or pricing structure. As proposed here, the entity would be assessed exactly the same amount for a given level of activity whether it acted as an ATS or as an exchange. Accordingly, the Participants do not believe that adoption of the CAT NMS Plan would favor existing exchanges or types of exchanges vis-&#224;-vis potential new competitors in a way that would degrade available Execution Venue services or pricing. For similar reasons, the Participants also do not believe that the costs of the CAT NMS Plan would distort the marketplace for existing or potential registered securities associations.</p>
      <p id="ca488b8b-2acf-42c6-8018-cee58e022788">(ii) Broker-Dealers</p>
      <p id="92a072b4-cccf-4976-b177-1c70add47084">Broker-dealer competition may be impacted if the direct and indirect costs associated with meeting the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s requirements materially impact the provision of their services to the public. Further, competition may be harmed if a particular class or group of broker-dealers bears the costs disproportionately, and as a result, investors have more limited choices or increased costs for certain types of broker-dealer services.</p>
      <p id="7d4a0934-5aa8-413a-9864-1bb569858bd8">For larger broker-dealers, the Participants rely on the information obtained from the Costs to CAT Reporters Study and discussions with the industry to preliminarily conclude that the CAT NMS Plan will not likely have an adverse impact on competition. Under the CAT NMS Plan, broker-dealers would be assessed charges, as determined by the Operating Committee, for the build and maintenance of the CAT. They would also incur costs to build and maintain systems and processes necessary to submit and retain their own information to the Central Repository. The Participants&#8217; efforts to align costs with market activity leads to an outcome where dollar costs are borne significantly more by larger entities.</p>
      <p id="f3889ca3-982d-4c00-8656-43dacc363337">Additionally, large broker-dealers may view themselves as direct competitors to large Participants, in that they may provide similar execution services. The CAT NMS Plan seeks to mitigate competitive impacts by aligning the cost allocation in a manner that seeks comparability among the largest CAT Reporters regardless of their regulatory status.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz46-6" NAME="fr_pz46-6">228</a></p>
      <p id="e2ecbed9-3f87-4e74-b965-ac0bddd6e3ec">According to the Costs to CAT Reporters Study, for large broker-dealers, the average decrease in maintenance costs associated with the CAT (i.e., the cost that CAT would impose on firms beyond the current economic baseline) would be $651,924, and the average decrease in maintenance costs for small firms would be $726,216 using Approach 1. For Approach 2, large broker-dealers would see a decrease in maintenance costs associated with the CAT of $1,170,548, and small firms would see a decrease in the same costs of $763,371. These averages could suggest that the decreased costs imposed by the CAT would represent a benefit to both large and small broker-dealers&#8217; regulatory budgets. The Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan would not materially disadvantage small broker-dealers versus large broker-dealers.</p>
      <p id="0fcd50e2-6ae6-4430-ae6e-9911e6926488">For small broker-dealers, the Participants considered their contribution to market activity as an important determinant of the amount of the cost of the CAT that they should bear. While this allocation of costs may be significant for some small firms, and may even impact their business models materially, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> requires these entities to report. The Participants have not identified a way to further minimize the costs to these firms within the context of the funding principles established as part of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="2c79d867-05b0-4a73-9cb6-6f676208d784">The Participants were particularly sensitive during the development of the CAT NMS Plan to the potential burdens it could place on small broker-dealers. These broker-dealers may incur minimal costs under existing audit trail requirements because they are OATS-exempt or excluded broker-dealers or limited purpose broker-dealers. The Participants note that the CAT NMS Plan contemplates steps to diffuse the potential cost differential between large and small firms. For instance, small broker-dealers generally will have an additional year before they are required to start reporting data under the CAT NMS Plan to the Central Repository. This will permit these firms greater time to implement the changes to their own systems necessary to comply with the Plan. Furthermore, the Participants have sought exemptive relief concerning time stamps for recording the time of Manual Order Events.</p>
      <p id="73419a53-fcbc-4044-84ff-21205fc5f480">The Participants are cognizant that the method by which costs are allocated to broker-dealers may have implications for their business models that might ultimately impact competition. For instance, if the method of cost allocation created disincentives to quoting activity, certain broker-dealer&#8217;s business models might be affected more greatly than others. The Participants are unable to determine whether and how changing these incentives may impact competition. Participants intend to monitor changes to overall market activity and market quality and consider appropriate changes to the cost allocation model where merited.</p>
      <p id="fdd28981-7244-44c2-a42f-5227471ff046">The Participants note that if the exemption requests that have been submitted to the Commission are not granted, the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> may impose significantly greater costs that could potentially cause small broker-dealers to exit the marketplace, discourage new entrants to the small broker-dealer marketplace, or impact the broker-dealer landscape in other ways that may dampen competitive pressures.</p>
      <p id="3d7417f1-29e4-4cb4-b4a6-b347bae6bd03">(b) Impact on Efficiency</p>
      <p id="b9d2516e-ded9-49b0-b813-5348aedbf4ab">Through an analysis of the data and information described above, the Participants have evaluated the impact of the CAT NMS Plan on efficiency, including the impact on the time, resources and effort needed to perform various regulatory and other functions. In general, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan should have a net positive effect on efficiency.</p>
      <p id="ce796a46-c684-4252-9724-11445db2dff0">Overall, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan could improve market efficiency by reducing monitoring costs and increasing efficiency in the enforcement of Participant and Commission rules. Additionally, the Participants believe that the CAT will enable the Participants and the Commission to detect more quickly wrongdoing on a cross-market basis, which may deter some market participants from taking such actions. For example, FINRA&#8217;s equity cross-market surveillance patterns have already demonstrated the value of integrating data from multiple markets. FINRA has found that approximately 44 percent of the manipulation-based alerts it generated involved conduct on two or more equity markets and 43 percent of the alerts involved conduct by two or more market participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-7" NAME="fr_pz47-7">229</a> A reduction in prohibited activity, as well as faster identification of such activity by regulators, would lead to a reduction in losses to investors and increased efficiency.</p>
      <p id="071068c1-6b5f-4599-9a44-641d5955e232">The CAT could also create more focused efficiencies for broker-dealers and Participants by reducing the redundant and overlapping systems and requirements identified above. For all CAT Reporters, the standardization of various technology systems will provide, over time, improved process efficiencies, including efficiencies gained through the replacement of outdated processes and technology with cost saving and related staffing reductions. Standardization of systems will improve efficiency, for both Participants and broker-dealers, in the form of resource consolidation, sun-setting of systems, consolidated legacy systems and processes and consolidated data processing. In addition, more sophisticated monitoring may reduce the number of ad hoc information requests, thereby reducing the overall burden and increasing the operational efficiency of CAT Reporters.</p>
      <p id="b5a3c3c9-9024-4f43-b9ea-aafde5b54b1f">CAT Reporters may also experience various long term efficiencies from the increase in surveillance capabilities, such as greater efficiencies related to administrative functions provided by enhanced regulatory access, superior system speed and reduced system downtime. Moreover, the Commission and the Participants expect to have more fulsome access to unprocessed regulatory data and timely and accurate information on market activity, thus providing the opportunity for improved market surveillance and monitoring.</p>
      <p id="0412f718-fc46-449e-8fea-eaf2ca3bdeff">Note, however, that uniform reporting of data to the Central Repository may require the development of data mapping and data dictionaries that will impose burdens in the short term. CAT Reporters also may incur additional time and direct costs to comply with new encryption mechanisms in connection with the transmission of PII data (although the quality of the process will improve).</p>
      <p id="0ed6134b-9503-4f25-8a47-c496d82b0232">The Participants are cognizant that the method by which costs are allocated to broker-dealers may have implications for their business models that might ultimately impact efficiency. For instance, if the method of cost allocation created disincentives to the provision of liquidity, there may be an impact on the quality of the markets and an increase in the costs to investors to transact. As a result, the Participants set forth the funding principles that will guide the selection of the cost allocation model. The Participants have also sought out evidence available to best understand how cost allocation models may impact market participation, and more importantly, ultimately market outcomes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-9" NAME="fr_pz48-9">230</a></p>
      <p id="22ecd991-5575-436f-8d9b-677be9beed4e">The Participants intend to monitor changes to overall market activity and market quality and will consider appropriate changes to the cost allocation model where merited.</p>
      <p id="b6dc34f0-c974-4eb4-989c-ad65da225105">(c) Impact on Capital Formation</p>
      <p id="562604fd-060d-437f-9b54-8a39b7f0d12c">Through an analysis of the data and information described above, the Participants also have assessed the impact of the CAT NMS Plan on capital formation, including the impact on both investments and the formation of additional capital. In general, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan will have no deleterious effect on capital formation.</p>
      <p id="e64fdfd3-ab6a-4684-adb9-0c8bdace70fa">In general the Participants believe that the enhanced surveillance of the markets may instill greater investor confidence in the markets, which, in turn, may prompt greater participation in the markets. It is possible that greater investor participation in the markets could bolster capital formation by supporting the environment in which companies raise capital.</p>
      <p id="fea96878-9c3e-482a-a0ea-8d3438484b7e">Moreover, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan would not discourage capital formation. As discussed in greater detail above, the Participants have analyzed the degree to which the CAT NMS Plan should cover Primary Market Transactions. Based on this analysis, the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan has been appropriately tailored so it does not create an undue burden on the primary issuances that companies may use to raise capital.</p>
      <p id="79cf1b3d-1455-4ca3-aa83-a6c49cfba82a">In addition, the Participants do not believe that the costs of the CAT NMS Plan would come to bear on investors in a way that would materially limit their access to or participation in the capital markets.</p>
      <p id="053324c6-b087-4b8a-b7d7-8135a779bfd9">Finally, the Participants believe that, given the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s provisions to secure the data collected and stored by the Central Repository, the CAT NMS Plan should not discourage participation by market participants who are worried about data security and data breaches. As described more fully in the CAT NMS Plan and Appendix C, The Security and Confidentiality of the Information Reported to the Central Repository, and Appendix D, Data Security, the Plan Processor will be responsible for ensuring the security and confidentiality of data during transmission and processing, as well as at rest, and for ensuring that the data is used only for permitted purposes. The Plan Processor will be required to provide physical security for facilities where data is transmitted or stored, and must provide for the security of electronic access to data by outside parties, including Participants and the Commission, CAT Reporters, or Data Submitters. The Plan Processor must include in these measures heightened security for populating, storing, and retrieving particularly sensitive data such as PII. Moreover, the Plan Processor must develop and maintain this security program with a dedicated staff including, among others, a Chief Information Security Officer dedicated to monitoring and addressing data security issues for the Plan Processor and Central Repository, subject to regular review by the Chief Compliance Officer. The Plan Processor also will be required to provide regular reports to the Operating Committee on a number of items, including any data security issues for the Plan Processor and Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="4cc5ff39-19e4-42df-aca0-1060563089e4">(d) Impacts of the CAT NMS Plan Governance on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation</p>
      <p id="f0552938-36f5-46ee-acfe-69933e6b36ac">Participants considered the impacts of the CAT NMS Plan governance on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Participants recognize that without effective governance, it will become harder for the CAT NMS Plan to achieve its intended outcome, namely, enhanced investor protection, in an efficient manner. Participants specifically considered two areas where ineffective governance might lead to economic distortions or inefficiencies: (i) the voting protocols defined in the CAT NMS Plan both for Participants in developing the CAT, and for the Operating Committee after the adoption of the CAT NMS Plan; and (ii) the role of industry advisors within the context of CAT NMS Plan governance.</p>
      <p id="b69d199b-85a9-4a9a-9649-8c3667d2a57d">Participants understand that there may be detrimental impacts to adopting voting protocols that might impede the effective administration of the CAT System. For instance, too high a threshold for decision making may limit the ability of the body to adopt broadly agreed upon provisions. The extreme form of this would have been for the CAT NMS Plan to require unanimity on all matters. In such case, one dissenting opinion could effectively derail the entire decision-making apparatus. The inability to act in a timely way may create consequences for efficiency, competition, and capital. Conversely, if Participants set a voting threshold that is too low, it might have the impact of not giving sufficient opportunity to be heard or value to dissenting opinions and alternative approaches. As an example, if Participants were to set voting thresholds too low, it might be possible for a set of Participants to adopt provisions that might provide them a competitive advantage over other Participants. Either forms (a too high or too low threshold) could result in negative impacts to efficiency, competition, and capital formation. These issues apply in the context of efforts of the Participants to develop the CAT NMS Plan submitted here or in the context of the Operating Committee&#8217;s responsibilities after approval of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="a239fb7a-fd65-4c6e-a40a-b0a86abf7140">To address these concerns, Participants carefully considered which matters should require a Supermajority Vote and which matters should require a Majority Vote.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz50-8" NAME="fr_pz50-8">231</a> The decision required Participants to balance the protection of rights of all parties with the interest of avoiding unnecessary deadlock in the decision making process. As a result, Participants have determined that use of a Supermajority Vote should be for instances considered by the Participants to have a direct and significant impact on the functioning, management, and financing of the CAT System. This formulation, relying on Majority Vote for routine decisions and Supermajority Vote for significant matters, is intended to meet the Commission&#8217;s direction for &#8220;efficient and fair operation of the NMS plan governing the consolidated audit trail.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz50-9" NAME="fr_pz50-9">232</a></p>
      <p id="363d1d8a-b8a8-4472-b135-fb85e5d4eba0">Participants also considered the role of industry representation as part of the governance structure. Participants recognize the importance of including industry representation in order to assure that all affected parties have a representative in discussing the building, implementation, and maintenance of the CAT System. Participants actively sought insight and information from the DAG and other industry representatives in developing the CAT NMS Plan. The CAT NMS Plan also contemplates continued industry representation through an Advisory Committee, intended to support the Operating Committee and to promote continuing efficiency in meeting the objective of the CAT.</p>

      <p id="80101d7c-a0cf-4947-9f27-1cfec735d82c">Order Audit Trail System (&#8220;OATS&#8221;)</p>
      <p id="69db7992-5abf-4ab6-b7cc-868bdd84b51c">The OATS Rules impose obligations on FINRA members to record in electronic form and report to FINRA, on a daily basis, certain information with respect to orders originated, received, transmitted, modified, canceled, or executed by members relating to OTC equity securities<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-5" NAME="fr_pz55-5">236</a> and NMS Securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-6" NAME="fr_pz55-6">237</a> OATS captures this order information and integrates it with quote and transaction information to create a time-sequenced record of orders, quotes, and transactions. This information is then used by FINRA staff to conduct surveillance and investigations of member firms for potential violations of FINRA rules and federal securities laws. In general, the OATS Rules apply to any FINRA member that is a &#8220;Reporting Member,&#8221; which is defined in <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4431">Rule 7410</a> as &#8220;a member that receives or originates an order and has an obligation to record and report information under <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4434">Rules 7440</a> and <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4435">7450</a>.&#8221;</p>
      <p id="5f2dcb8b-75ad-4e74-bd6f-5f10c091ac61">Although FINRA is committed to retiring OATS in as efficient and timely a manner as practicable, its ability to retire OATS is dependent on a number of events. Most importantly, before OATS can be retired, the Central Repository must contain CAT Data sufficient to ensure that FINRA can effectively conduct surveillance and investigations of its members for potential violations of FINRA rules and federal laws and regulations, which includes ensuring that the CAT Data is complete and accurate. Consequently, one of the first steps taken by the Participants to address the elimination of OATS was an analysis of gaps between the informational requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> and current OATS recording and reporting rules. In particular, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(c)(5) and (6)</a> require reporting of data only for each NMS Security that is (a) registered or listed for trading on a national securities exchange; (b) or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on such exchange; or (c) for which reports are required to be submitted to the national securities association. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(i)</a> requires the Participants to provide to the Commission within six months after the Effective Date a document outlining how the Participants could incorporate into the consolidated audit trail information with respect to equity securities that are not NMS Securities (&#8220;OTC Equity Securities&#8221;) and debt securities (and Primary Market Transactions in such securities). Even though <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> does not require reporting of OTC Equity Securities, the Participants have agreed to expand the reporting requirements to include OTC Equity Securities to facilitate the elimination of OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-4" NAME="fr_pz56-4">238</a></p>
      <p id="921948df-811a-4815-8eba-31ba20c8975e">Next, the Participants performed a detailed analysis of the current OATS requirements and the specific reporting obligations under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> and concluded that there are 42 data elements found in both OATS and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>; however, there are 33 data elements currently captured in OATS that are not specified in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-5" NAME="fr_pz56-5">239</a> The Participants believe it is appropriate to incorporate data elements into the Central Repository that are necessary to retire OATS and the OATS Rules. The Participants believe that these additional data elements will increase the likelihood that the Central Repository will include sufficient order information to ensure FINRA can continue to perform its surveillance with CAT Data rather than OATS data and can, thus, more quickly eliminate OATS and the OATS Rules.</p>
      <p id="1f536076-c245-4e7a-b8b4-6eab189f82d4">The purpose of OATS is to collect data to be used by FINRA staff to conduct surveillance and investigations of member firms for potential violations of FINRA rules and federal securities laws and regulations. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> requires the Participants to include in the CAT NMS Plan a requirement that all Industry Members report information to the Central Repository within three years after the Effective Date. Consistent with this provision, under the terms of <a href="#5edb0c0f-f728-48c8-87ef-71b63da1eeeb">Sections 6.4</a> and <a href="#dff8ed32-363b-4829-b1df-48ea9687d6bb">6.7 of the CAT NMS Plan</a>, some Reporting Members will not be reporting information to the Central Repository until three years after the Effective Date. Because FINRA must continue to perform its surveillance obligations without interruption, OATS cannot be entirely eliminated until all FINRA members who currently report to OATS are reporting CAT Data to the Central Repository. However, FINRA will monitor its ability to integrate CAT Data with OATS data to determine whether it can continue to perform its surveillance obligations. If it is practicable to integrate the data in a way that ensures no interruption in FINRA&#8217;s surveillance capabilities, FINRA will consider exempting firms from the OATS Rules provided they report data to the Central Repository pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan and any implementing rules.</p>
      <p id="95fa0d07-d4a3-444e-ae57-d381e8f33dd1">FINRA&#8217;s ability to eliminate OATS reporting obligations is dependent upon the ability of the Plan Processor and FINRA to work together to integrate CAT Data with the data collected by OATS. FINRA is committed to working diligently with the Plan Processor to ensure this process occurs in a timely manner; however, it is anticipated that Reporting Members will have to report to both OATS and the Central Repository for some period of time until FINRA can verify that the data into the Central Repository is of sufficient quality for surveillance purposes and that all reporting requirements meet the established steady state Error Rates set forth in Section A.3(b). Once this is verified, FINRA&#8217;s goal is to minimize the dual-reporting requirement.</p>
      <p id="e7f65dd3-c7d8-4f19-920f-048c0384db1c">Finally, the Participants note that, pursuant to <a href="">Section 19 of the Exchange Act</a>, the amendment or elimination of the OATS Rules can only be done with Commission approval. Approval of any such filings is dependent upon a number of factors, including public notice and comment and required findings by the Commission before it can approve any amendments; therefore, FINRA cannot speculate how long this process may ultimately take.</p>

      <p id="bc0b7798-b43c-4ac8-94f4-3ab970cb0646">When the Participants first began creating a CAT pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, the Participants developed the following guiding principles (the &#8220;Guiding Principles&#8221;):</p>
      <p id="ce22088d-2704-4f78-a5c4-6f29b78b5208">i. The CAT must meet the specific requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> and achieve the primary goal of creating a single, comprehensive audit trail to enhance regulators&#8217; ability to surveil the U.S. markets in an effective and efficient way.</p>
      <p id="40811158-dd67-4778-93c9-74f0a5dfabff">ii. The reporting requirements and technology infrastructure developed must be adaptable to changing market structures and reflective of trading practices, as well as scalable to increasing market volumes.</p>
      <p id="b1d527c2-216b-4bc6-aec8-51232a62c683">iii. The costs of developing, implementing, and operating the CAT should be minimized to the extent possible. To this end, existing reporting structures and technology interfaces will be utilized where practicable.</p>
      <p id="d7b6c25c-2cd0-4b4e-936c-2731800f9bba">iv. Industry input is a critical component in the creation of the CAT. The Participants will consider industry feedback before decisions are made with respect to reporting requirements and cost allocation models.</p>
      <p id="7c73ad03-2916-4aa5-9111-189f0801a08d">The Participants explicitly recognized in the Guiding Principles that meaningful input by the industry was integral to the successful creation and implementation of the CAT, and as outlined below, the Participants have taken numerous steps throughout this process to ensure the industry and the public have a voice in the process.</p>

The Participants reviewed and discussed this feedback with the DAG, and incorporated portions of it into the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="e6993a43-255e-4d9c-8ee8-017944f796e4">&#8226; Options Market Maker Quotes. The DAG discussed the impact of options market maker quotes on the industry. A cost analysis was conducted by the industry trade associations to analyze the impact of market maker quote reporting, as well as adding a &#8220;quote sent&#8221; time stamp to messages sent to exchanges by all options market makers The Participants included in the Exemptive Request Letters a request for exemptive relief related to option market maker quotes given that exchanges will be reporting this data to the CAT.</p>
      <p id="c069aa3f-1290-4d46-975e-29c2a636695a">&#8226; Customer-ID. The DAG discussed the requirements for capturing Customer-ID. The Participants proposed a Customer Information Approach in which broker-dealers assign a unique Firm Designated ID to each Customer and the Plan Processor creates and stores the Customer-ID. This concept was supported by the DAG and the Participants included in the Exemptive Request Letters a request for exemptive relief related to the Customer-ID to reduce the reporting on CAT Reporters.</p>
      <p id="c9e9ce20-c0ce-4e81-a106-53896fbe5c31">&#8226; Time Stamp, Clock Synchronization and Clock Drift. The DAG discussed time stamps in regards to potential exemptive relief on the time stamp requirements for allocations and Manual Order Events. In addition, industry clock synchronization processes were discussed as well as the feasibility of specific clock drift requirements (e.g., 50ms), with the DAG and the FIF conducting an industry survey to identify the costs and challenges associated with various levels of clock synchronization requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz67-8" NAME="fr_pz67-8">243</a> The Participants included in the Exemptive Request Letters a request for exemptive relief related to manual time stamps.</p>
      <p id="dd242a74-f6d8-42e6-aa49-6eae21fff568">&#8226; Exemptive Request Letters. In addition to the specific areas detailed above (Options Market Maker Quotes, Customer-ID, and Time Stamp, Clock Synchronization, and Clock Drift), the DAG provided input and feedback on draft versions of the Exemptive Request Letters prior to their filing with the SEC, including cost estimates to firms and the Industry as a whole should the exemptive requests not be granted. This feedback was discussed by the Participants and the DAG and incorporated into the Exemptive Request Letters. The DAG also provided input and feedback on the Exemptive Request Letters covering Linking Allocations to Executions and Account Effective Date submitted on April 3, 2015 and September 2, 2015 respectively.</p>
      <p id="6d6d038b-6fdf-411f-b589-269721052b70">&#8226; Primary Markets. At the request of the Participants, the DAG discussed with the Participants the feasibility, costs, and benefits associated with reporting allocations of NMS Securities in Primary Market Transactions. The DAG further provided estimated costs associated with reporting allocations of NMS Securities in Primary Market Transactions at the top-account and sub-account levels, which was incorporated into the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz68-6" NAME="fr_pz68-6">244</a></p>
      <p id="8eebcca6-5deb-4e07-bc8f-a994fa0d96fd">&#8226; Order Handling Scenarios. The DAG discussed potential CAT reporting requirements for certain order handling scenarios and additional corresponding sub-scenarios (e.g., riskless principal order and sub-scenarios involving post-execution print-for-print matching, pre-execution one-to-one matching, pre-execution many-to-one matching, complex options and auctions) An Industry Member and Participant working group was established to discuss order handling scenarios in more detail.</p>
      <p id="c08407e8-faee-40e8-85ff-6fa6bc93182c">&#8226; Error Handling and Correction Process. The DAG discussed error handling and correction process. Industry Members of the DAG provided recommendations for making the CAT error correction processes more efficient. The Participants have reviewed and analyzed these recommended solutions for error correction processes and incorporated them in the requirements for the Plan Processor.</p>
      <p id="8924b9ab-a1a7-48d8-89b4-c401e282bd75">&#8226; Elimination of Systems. The DAG discussed the gaps between CAT and both OATS and EBS. An OATS-EBS-CAT gap analysis was developed and published on the CAT NMS Plan Website to identify commonalities and redundancies between the systems and the functionality of the CAT. Additionally, gaps between LTID and the CAT were also developed. Additional examples of systems and rules being analyzed include, but are not limited to: CBOE Rule 8.9, <a href="http://nasdaqphlx.cchwallstreet.com/">PHLX Rule 1022</a>, COATS, Equity Cleared Reports, LOPR, and <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=6288">FINRA Rule 4560</a>.</p>
      <p id="21b5e845-5164-45ab-bd9f-73623b5a3bf1">&#8226; Cost and Funding of the CAT. The DAG helped to develop the cost study that was distributed to Industry Members. Additionally, the Participants have discussed with the DAG the funding principles for the CAT and potential funding models.</p>
      <p id="4f575f8e-787d-48d1-9aa1-36589eefc5c6">In addition, a subgroup of the DAG has met six times to discuss equity and option order handling scenarios, order types, how and whether the orders are currently reported and how linkages could be created for the orders within the CAT.</p>
      <p id="f71cd832-0552-4226-b007-0673e4d15603">(b) Summary of Views Expressed by Members and Other Parties and How Participants Took Those Views Into Account in Preparing the CAT NMS Plan</p>
      <p id="7692e1ea-543a-4274-bce2-bfe39af4aaf6">The various perspectives of Industry Members and other appropriate parties informed the Participants&#8217; consideration of operational and technical issues during the development of the CAT NMS Plan. In addition to the regular DAG meetings and special industry calls and events noted above, the Participants conducted multiple group working sessions to discuss the industry&#8217;s unique perspectives on CAT-related operational and technical issues. These sessions included discussions of options and equity order scenarios and the RFP specifications and requirements.</p>
      <p id="fb316c98-7437-499a-ac04-5bdfd2d93607">Industry feedback was provided to Participants through gap analyses, cost studies, comment letters and active discussion in DAG meetings and industry outreach events. Specific topics on which the industry provided input include:</p>
      <p id="96dbff70-f80d-4344-bb27-1f7f23b6ef6b">Overall Timeline. Industry Members expressed a concern that the original timeline for implementation of the CAT is significantly shorter than the timeline for other large scale requirements such as Large Trader Reporting. The industry requested that, in developing the overall timeline for development and implementation of the CAT NMS Plan, the Participants account for additional industry comment/input on specifications in the official timeline and discussed risk mitigation strategies for implementation of the Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="df025784-ff74-4f70-bfea-efebbe863299">Request for proposal. The Participants provided relevant excerpts of the RFP to DAG members for review and input. These sections were discussed by the Participants, and appropriate feedback was incorporated prior to publishing the RFP.</p>
      <p id="8b466a82-7897-4288-a2d5-19903a325a32">Options Market Maker Quotes. Industry Members expressed the view that requiring market makers to provide quote information to the CAT will be duplicative of information already being submitted to the CAT by the exchanges. Participants worked closely with DAG members to develop an alternative approach that will meet the goals of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, and which is detailed in the Exemptive Request Letter that the Participants submitted to the Commission related to manual time stamps.</p>
      <p id="f141f014-7c3a-485e-9254-9aaecfe8dfd0">Customer-ID. Extensive DAG discussions reviewed the Customer-ID requirements in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. The industry expressed significant concern that the complexities of adding a unique CAT customer identifier to order reporting would introduce significant costs and effort related to the system modifications and business process changes broker-dealers would face in order to implement this requirement of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. Working with Industry Members, the Participants proposed a Customer Information Approach in which broker-dealers would assign a unique Firm Designated ID to each Customer which the Plan Processor would retain. Additional feedback was provided by the DAG for the use of the Legal Entity Identifier (&#8220;LEI&#8221;) as a valid unique customer identifier as an alternative to Tax Identification Numbers to identify non-natural person accounts. This Customer Information Approach is included in the Exemptive Request Letters that the Participants submitted to the Commission.</p>
      <p id="06785d35-8cb5-47c2-a77a-82858122b152">Error Correction. DAG members discussed the criticality of CAT Data quality to market surveillance and reconstruction, as well as the need for a robust process for the timely identification and correction of errors. Industry Members provided feedback on error correction objectives and processes, including the importance of those data errors not causing linkage breaks. This feedback was incorporated into the RFP and relevant portions of the PPR.</p>
      <p id="4bf755dc-5b7f-4bcf-bbe9-e51b797e2a7a">Industry Members also suggested that CAT Reporters be provided access to their submitted data. Participants discussed the data security and cost considerations of this request and determined that it was not a cost-effective requirement for the CAT.</p>
      <p id="aa184b29-6dc3-4ca5-b008-d9685872f62b">Governance of the CAT. Industry Members provided detailed recommendation for the integration of Industry Members into the governance of the CAT, including an expansion of the proposed Advisory Committee to include industry associations such as FIF and SIFMA. Industry Members also recommended a three-year term with one-third turnover per year is recommended to provide improved continuity given the complexity of CAT processing.</p>
      <p id="2c03005f-871b-4ac3-b822-85e585b6185f">The Participants have discussed CAT governance considerations with the DAG at several meetings. The Participants incorporated industry feedback into the CAT NMS Plan to the extent possible in light of the regulatory responsibilities placed solely upon the Participants under the provisions of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. The proposed structure and composition of the Advisory Committee in Article 4.12 was discussed with the DAG in advance of the submission of this Plan.</p>
      <p id="e7570ced-d53c-4aa4-aa42-a35d98de9070">Role of Operating Committee. The Operating Committee, consisting of one voting member representing each Participant, is structured to ensure fair and equal representation of the Participants in furtherance of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(b)(1)</a>. The overarching role of the Operating Committee is to manage the Company and the CAT System similar to the manner in which a board of directors manages the business and affairs of a corporation. The primary and more specific role of the Operating Committee is to make all policy decisions on behalf of the Company in furtherance of the functions and objectives of the Company under the Exchange Act, any rules thereunder, including <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, and the CAT NMS Plan. In connection with its role, the Operating Committee has the right, power and authority to exercise all of the powers of the Company, to make all decisions, and to authorize or otherwise approve all actions by the Company, except as otherwise provided by applicable law or as otherwise provided in the CAT NMS Plan (Section 4.1 of the CAT NMS Plan). The Operating Committee also monitors, supervises and oversees the actions of the Plan Processor, the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer, all of whom are involved with the CAT System on a more detailed and day-to-day basis.</p>
      <p id="3a20dfc6-aef6-4f0e-96ac-d18b0900e5b2">The decisions made by the Operating Committee include matters that are typically considered ordinary course for a governing body like a board of directors (e.g., approval of compensation of the Chief Compliance Officer (Section 6.2(a)(iv) the CAT NMS Plan) and approval to hold an executive session of the Operating Committee (Section 4.3(a)(v) of the CAT NMS Plan)), in addition to matters that are specific to the functioning, management and financing of the CAT System (e.g., changes to Technical Specifications (Sections 4.3(b)(vi)-(vii) of the CAT NMS Plan) and significant changes to the CAT System (Section 4.3(b)(v) of the CAT NMS Plan)).</p>
      <p id="4c2c355d-5c72-48df-bea7-70c2c136d879">The CAT NMS Plan sets forth a structure for decisions that the Operating Committee may make after approval of the CAT NMS Plan by the SEC. These decisions relate to events that may occur in the future as a result of the normal operation of any business (e.g., additional capital contributions (<a href="#b562bd42-c4e6-4a85-b116-6a5e0e17cb55">Section 3.8 of the CAT NMS Plan</a>), approval of a loan to the Company (<a href="#a71624af-3245-4d08-a031-2a9b50c642a7">Section 3.9 of the CAT NMS Plan</a>)) or that may occur due to the operation of the CAT System (e.g., the amount of the Participation Fee to be paid by a prospective Participant (Section 3.3(a) of the CAT NMS Plan)). These decisions cannot be made at the time of approval of the CAT NMS Plan because the Operating Committee will need to make its determination based on the facts and circumstances as they exist in the future. For example, in determining the appropriate Participation Fee, the Operating Committee will apply the factors identified in Section 3.3 of the CAT NMS Plan (e.g., costs of the Company and previous fees paid by other new Participants) to the facts existing at the time the prospective Participant is under consideration. Another example is the establishment of funding for the Company and fees for Participants and Industry Members. Section 11.2 of the CAT NMS Plan sets forth factors and principles that the Operating Committee will use in determining the funding of the Company. The Operating Committee then has the ability to review the annual budget and operations and costs of the CAT System to determine the appropriate funding and fees at the relevant future time. This approach, which sets forth standards at the time the CAT NMS Plan is approved that will be applied to future facts and circumstances, provides the Operating Committee with guiding principles to aid its decision-making in the future.</p>
      <p id="5b50daea-78ad-43ea-9cec-2a66466d27b6">The Participants also recognize that certain decisions that are fundamental and significant to the operation of the Company and the CAT System must require the prior approval of the SEC, such as the use of new factors in determining a Participation Fee (Section 3.3(b)(v) of the CAT NMS Plan). In addition, any decision that requires an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan, such as termination of a Participant (Section 3.7(b) of the CAT NMS Plan), requires prior approval of the SEC (<a href="#e6149dac-4ab2-4ed0-81ff-0b55c0d5abcb">Section 12.3 of the CAT NMS Plan</a>).</p>
      <p id="6770b730-850f-499e-8ce5-4a8105885fee">The Operating Committee has the authority to delegate administrative functions related to the management of the business and affairs of the Company to one or more Subcommittees and other Persons; however, the CAT NMS Plan expressly states that the Operating Committee may not delegate its policy-making functions (except to the extent policy-making determinations are already delegated as set forth in the CAT NMS Plan, which determinations will have been approved by the SEC) (Section 4.1 of the CAT NMS Plan). For example, the CAT NMS Plan provides for the formation of a Compliance Subcommittee to aid the Chief Compliance Officer in performing compliance functions, including (1) the maintenance of confidentiality of information submitted to the CAT; (2) the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of information; and (3) the manner and extent to which each Participant is meeting its compliance obligations under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> and the CAT NMS Plan (Section 4.12(b) of the CAT NMS Plan). The Operating Committee also has delegated authority to the Plan Processor with respect to the normal day-to-day operating function of the Central Repository (Section 6.1 of the CAT NMS Plan). Nevertheless, decisions made by the Plan Processor that are more significant in nature remain subject to approval by the Operating Committee, such as decisions related to the implementation of policies and procedures (Section 6.1(c) of the CAT NMS Plan), appointment of the Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Independent Auditor (Section 6.1(b) of the CAT NMS Plan), Material System Changes or any system changes for regulatory compliance (Sections 6.1(i) and 6.1(j) of the CAT NMS Plan). In addition, the Operating Committee will conduct a formal review of the Plan Processor&#8217;s performance under the CAT NMS Plan on an annual basis (Section 6.1(n) of the CAT NMS Plan). As to Subcommittees that the Operating Committee may form in the future, the Participants have determined that the Operating Committee will establish a Selection Subcommittee to select a successor Plan Processor when the time arises (Section 6.1(t) of the CAT NMS Plan). In the future, the Operating Committee will take a similar approach when delegating authority by providing Subcommittees or other Persons with discretion with respect to administrative functions and retaining authority to approve decisions related to policy and other significant matters of the Company and the CAT System.</p>
      <p id="86c652bb-9493-4b37-bcc6-be68db6e2392">The role of the Operating Committee, including the delegation of its authority to Subcommittees and other limited Persons, as provided in the CAT NMS Plan is similar to that of other national market system plans, including the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Options Price Reporting Authority, LLC. It also is based on rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, and general principles with respect to the governance of a limited liability company. All decisions made by the Operating Committee will be governed by the guiding principles of the CAT NMS Plan and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>.</p>
      <p id="97140cae-87ad-4cc7-9fef-945873189601">Voting Criteria of the Operating Committee: This section describes the voting criteria for decisions made by the Operating Committee, which consists of a representative for each Participant, and by any Subcommittee of the Operating Committee in the management and supervision of the business of the Company and the CAT System.</p>
      <p id="ae9900f6-5c7b-484a-a7a1-0c64ad017fe8">A Majority Vote (an affirmative vote of at least a majority of all members of the Operating Committee or any Subcommittee authorized to vote on a particular matter) is the default standard for decisions that are typically considered ordinary course matters for a governing body like a board of directors or board of managers or that address the general governance and function of the Operating Committee and its Subcommittees. All actions of the Company requiring a vote by the Operating Committee or any Subcommittee requires authorization by a Majority Vote except for matters specified in certain sections of the CAT NMS Plan described below, which matters require either a Supermajority Vote or a unanimous vote. As a general matter, the approach adopted by the Operating Committee is consistent with the voting criteria of the NASDAQ Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan (the &#8220;NASDAQ UTP Plan&#8221;), the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Options Price Reporting Authority, LLC, the Consolidated Quotation Plan and the Consolidated Tape Association Plan.</p>
      <p id="b9c9a6c5-e09f-4285-b0f5-9d78be69f749">A Supermajority Vote (an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the members of the Operating Committee or any Subcommittee authorized to vote on a particular matter) is required to authorize decisions on matters that are outside ordinary course of business and are considered by the Participants to have a direct and significant impact on the functioning, management and financing of the CAT System. This approach was informed by similar plans (e.g., the NASDAQ UTP Plan, which requires a unanimous vote in many similar circumstances); however, the CAT NMS Plan has the lower requirement of a Supermajority Vote because overuse of the unanimity requirement makes management and oversight difficult. This approach takes into account concerns expressed by the Participants regarding management of the CAT NMS Plan, an is consistent with suggestions in the Adopting Release for the Participants to take into account t need for efficient and fair operation of the CAT NMS Plan and to consider the appropriateness of unanimity requirement and the possibility of a governance requirement other than unanimity, or even supermajority approval, for all but the most important decisions.</p>
      <p id="a7411a7e-9e1d-400b-87bb-29d1b200e889">The Participants believe that certain decisions that may directly impact the functioning and performance of the CAT System should be subject to the heightened standard of a Supermajority Vote, such as: selection and removal of the Plan Processor and key officers; approval of the initial Technical Specifications; approval of Material Amendments to the Technical Specifications proposed by the Plan Processor; and direct amendments to the Technical Specifications by the Operating Committee. In addition, the Participants believe the instances in which the Company enters into or modifies a Material Contract, incurs debt, makes distributions or tax elections or changes fee schedules should be limited, given that the Company is intended to operate on a break-even basis. Accordingly, those matters should also require the heightened standard of a Supermajority Vote.</p>
      <p id="71e29f47-2be2-4991-b24b-3d76fe2de959">A unanimous vote of all Participants is required in only three circumstances. First, a decision to obligate Participants to make a loan or capital contribution to the Company requires a unanimous vote (Section 3.8(a) of the CAT NMS Plan). Requiring Participants to provide additional financing to the Company is an event that imposes an additional and direct financial burden on each Participant, thus it is important that each Participant&#8217;s approval is obtained. Second, a decision by the Participants to dissolve the Company requires unanimity (Section 10.1 of the CAT NMS Plan). The dissolution of the Company is an extraordinary event that would have a direct impact on each Participant&#8217;s ability to meet its compliance requirements so it is critical that each Participant consents to this decision. Third, a unanimous vote is required if Participants decide to take an action by written consent in lieu of a meeting (<a href="#6a90c618-6e22-419e-af2f-f3902b78376f">Section 4.10 of the CAT NMS Plan</a>). In that case, because Participants will not have the opportunity to discuss and exchange ideas on the matter under consideration, all Participants must sign the written consent. This approach is similar to the unanimity requirement under the Delaware General Corporation Law for decisions made by written consent of the directors of a corporation in lieu of a meeting.</p>
      <p id="51c27270-4b94-461a-a6dc-39f585e00fa2">Voting on Behalf of Affiliated Participants: Each Participant has one vote on the Operating Committee to permit equal representation among all the Participants. Initially, the Operating Committee will have 19 Participants. Of the 19 Participants, there are five Participants that are part of the Affiliated Participants Group and five Participants without any Affiliated Participants. Because of the relationship between the respective Affiliated Participants and given the large number of Participants on the Operating Committee, the Participants believe an efficient and effective way of structuring the Operating Committee in order to have an orderly and well-functioning committee is to permit but not require one individual to serve as a voting member for multiple Affiliated Participants. This approach does not change the standard rule that each Participant has one vote. This approach provides Affiliated Participants with the flexibility to choose whether to have one individual represent one or more of the Affiliated Participants or to have each of them represented by a separate individual. Affiliated Participants may likely vote on a matter similarly, and allowing them to choose the same individual as a voting member would be a convenient and practical way of having the Affiliated Participants&#8217; votes cast. Because there is no requirement that the representative of multiple Affiliated Participants cast the same vote for all represented Participants, there is no practical difference between this approach and an approach that mandates a separate representative for each Participant. In addition, the Participants considered whether this approach would result in less participation because of a reduced number of individuals on the Operating Committee. If each group of Affiliated Participants were to choose one individual to serve as a voting member, there would be still be 10 individuals on the Operating Committee, which the Participants do not believe would cause less active representation or participation or would otherwise lead to unwanted concentration on the Operating Committee.</p>

      <p id="56e84f0a-80d5-41b7-b62f-1d8b387935c8">Transparency in the Bidding and Selection Process: DAG members requested input into the bidding and selection process for the Plan Processor, citing the extensive impact of CAT requirements on the industry as well as proposed cost for compliance. Specifically, Industry Members requested that non-proprietary aspects of the responses to the RFP should be available to the public to inform the discussion regarding the costs and benefits of various CAT features and the technological feasibility of different solutions. Participants, working with counsel, determined that such information could be appropriately shared with DAG members pursuant to the provisions of a non-disclosure agreement (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) that was consistent with the terms of the NDA executed between the Participants and the Bidders. After extensive discussion, DAG members declined to sign such an NDA. The Participants continued to share non-bid specific information and to solicit the views and perspective of DAG members as it developed a Plan approach and related solutions.</p>
      <p id="0c11ef0a-3228-41d8-a642-99ec92408426">Time Stamp Granularity and Clock Synchronization Requirement: Industry Members recommended a millisecond time stamp for electronic order and execution events and a time stamp in seconds for manual order handling. Industry Members suggested a grace period of two years after the CAT requirements are finalized to allow broker-dealers sufficient time to meet the millisecond time stamp granularity. In addition, Industry Members recommended maintaining the current OATS rule of a one second clock drift tolerance for electronic order and execution events, citing a significant burden to Industry Members to comply with a change to the current one-second clock drift.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-6" NAME="fr_pz75-6">245</a> Participants conducted active discussions with Industry Members on this topic, and included in the Exemptive Request Letter a request for exemptive relief related to time stamp granularity for Manual Order Events.</p>
      <p id="19c4680a-9eac-4262-af4c-f1ff423642d1">Equitable Cost and Funding: Industry Members expressed the view that any funding mechanism developed by the Participants should provide for equitable funding among all market participants, including the Participants. The Participants recognized the importance of this viewpoint and have incorporated it within the guiding principles that were discussed with the Industry.</p>
      <p id="0a6b0ea0-4ac4-418a-a2c1-a7569d6447b1">Order ID/Linkages: The DAG formed an order scenarios working group to discuss approaches to satisfy the order linkage requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. On the topic of allocations, Industry Members provided feedback that the order and execution processes are handled via front office systems, while allocation processes are conducted in the back office. Industry Members expressed the view that creating linkages between these systems, which currently operate independently, would require extensive reengineering of middle and back office processes not just within a broker-dealer but across broker-dealers, imposing significant additional costs on the industry as a whole. Given the widespread use of average price processing accounts, clearing firms, prime brokers and self-clearing firm cannot always determine which specific order results in a given allocation or allocations. Industry Members worked closely with Participants on a proposed alternative approach which the Participants submitted to the Commission in the Exemptive Request Letters.</p>
      <p id="3b038a59-7ec4-4169-a136-d3b8909390d7">Elimination of Systems and Rules: The elimination of duplicative and redundant systems and rules is a critical aspect of the CAT development process. Industry DAG members including SIFMA and FIF provided broad based and comprehensive insight on the list of existing regulatory systems and Participant rules that they deem to be duplicative, including, among others, OATS, the EBS reporting system, and Large Trader reporting. In addition, FIF provided a gap analysis of CAT requirements against Large Trader transactional reporting obligations.</p>
      <p id="6c0030db-e1c4-4f41-b20f-2bb006e7e40f">The Participants discussed feedback from the industry in a variety of forums: (i) during DAG meetings; (ii) in relevant Subcommittee meetings, depending on the topic; and (iii) at two multi-day offsite meetings where Representatives of each Participant gathered in a series of in-person workshops to discuss the requirements of the Plan Processor, both technical and operational. This was in addition to numerous video-conference meetings when Participants discussed and developed the RFP document incorporating, where appropriate, feedback from the industry.</p>

      <p id="eb82f721-fae5-43dd-b8f2-15e729adf488">Representatives from all Subcommittees met to discuss the overall progress of the CAT initiative in the Operating Committee.</p>
      <p id="a865c2b1-1752-4621-8d32-e8ad87210f38">To support the Participants&#8217; internal expertise, the Participants also engaged outside experts to assist in formulating the CAT NMS Plan. Specifically, the Participants engaged the consulting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP as a project manager, and engaged the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP to serve as legal counsel in drafting the CAT NMS Plan, both of which have extensive experience with issues raised by the CAT. Additionally, the Participants engaged the services of the public relations firm Peppercomm to assist with public relations and press engagement in formulating the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

      <p id="e09a841a-b4ac-4ffc-9d9d-5a5ffbdfa27d">Using this internal and external expertise, the Participants developed a process to identify, evaluate and resolve issues so as to finalize the CAT NMS Plan. As discussed above in Appendix C, the Participants have, among other things, developed the Selection Plan to describe the process for selecting the Plan Processor, created and published an RFP, evaluated Bids, and chosen a shortlist of Bids. Contemporaneously, the Participants have drafted the Plan set forth herein to reflect the recommendations that have resulted from the approach and analysis described above.</p>

After due consideration, with a view to meeting the demanding deadline set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, the Participants decided to use their expertise to craft an RFP seeking proposals to implement the main requirements to successfully build and operate the CAT.

      <p id="bd8f2c2f-dd0b-4603-8e47-46b62913274b">To design the RFP process, the Participants consulted with their technology subject matter resources to determine technical implications and requirements of the CAT and to develop the RFP. Based on these requirements, the Participants developed the Proposed RFP Concepts Document,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz77-8" NAME="fr_pz77-8">248</a> which identified the high level requirements for which potential Bidders would be expected to design a solution, ahead of publishing the full RFP on February 26, 2013. The Participants received 31 intents to bid, and then hosted a Bidder conference on March 8, 2013 to discuss the requirements and provide additional context to the industry and potential Bidders. Two additional conference calls to discuss additional questions on the RFP were held on April 25, 2013 and May 2, 2013. The Participants also established an e-mail box through which questions on the RFP were received.</p>
      <p id="dd407b8e-d2eb-40ab-97c4-ed99a5907b84">Ten competitive proposals were submitted on March 21, 2014. Each of the ten proposals was carefully reviewed by the Participants, including in-person meetings with each of the ten Bidders. Following this review, the Bids were reduced to six proposals in accordance with the Selection Plan approved by the Commission in February 2014. In accordance with the Selection Plan Amendment approved by the Commission on June 23, 2015, the Participants asked the Bidders on July 14, 2015 to revise their bids to account for the updated requirements included in the CAT NMS Plan as filed on February 27, 2015, as well as to address specific additional questions and considerations. As described more fully throughout this Appendix C, the proposals offer a variety of solutions for creating, implementing and maintaining the CAT.</p>
      <p id="76d55c98-9289-4a1f-bdc3-7bdf2f1cb108">As stated above, the Participants received proposals from ten Bidders that were deemed qualified, including many from large and well-respected information technology firms. The open ended nature of the questions contained in the RFP allowed Bidders to provide thoughtful and creative responses with regards to all aspects of the implementation and the operation of the CAT. The RFP process also resulted in the submission of multiple competitively-priced Bids. The six Shortlisted Bids remaining under consideration by the Participants, inclusive of the initial system build and the first five years of maintenance costs, have ranges between $165 million and $556 million, and encompass a number of innovative approaches to meeting the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, such as use of non-traditional database architectures and cloud-based infrastructure solutions.</p>
      <p id="bcac88f9-ee68-4a25-a6dc-ca1d3887f8e7">The Participants conducted the RFP process and the review of Bids pursuant to the Selection Plan approved by the Commission, which was designed to mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with Participants that are participating in developing the CAT while also seeking to become the Plan Processor and to ensure a level playing field for all potential Bidders to be considered on a fair and equal basis.</p>
      <p id="2c1236ed-fed2-46df-94e2-d31371528885">(b) Organizational Structure</p>
      <p id="d3cc7e3c-0b67-4bcc-8d91-2f83530b560c">The Participants considered various organizational structures of the Bidders to assess whether a particular structure would be a material factor in the ability of a Bidder to effectively operate as the Plan Processor. Of the Bids submitted, three general organizational structures for the Plan Processor emerged: (1) consortiums or partnerships (i.e., the Plan Processor would consist of more than one unaffiliated entity that would operate the CAT); (2) single firms (i.e., one entity would be the Plan Processor and that entity would operate the CAT as part of its other ongoing business operations); and (3) dedicated legal entities (i.e., CAT operations would be conducted in a separate legal entity that would perform no other business activities). Each type of organizational structure has strengths and limitations, but the Participants did not find that a particular organizational structure should be a material factor in selecting a Bidder. Accordingly the Participants have not mandated a specific organizational structure for the Plan Processor.</p>
      <p id="21c7b782-7cb4-457e-990e-6ed1d8098f3c">(c) Primary Storage</p>
      <p id="907e9d5d-e961-4e60-8584-1d4d5996a5d6">The Bidders proposed two methods of primary data storage: traditionally-hosted storage architecture, and infrastructure-as-a-service. Traditionally-hosted storage architecture is a model in which an organization would purchase and maintain proprietary servers and other hardware to store CAT Data. Infrastructure-as-a-service is a provisioning model in which an organization outsources the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware, servers and networking components to a third party who charges for the service on a usage basis.</p>
      <p id="481a2ba4-db41-4e5d-bc6d-a846e582580d">Each data storage method has a number of considerations that the Participants will take into account when evaluating each Bidder&#8217;s proposed solution. Such considerations include the maturity, cost, complexity, and reliability of the data storage method as used in each Bidder&#8217;s proposal. The Participants are not mandating a specific method for primary data storage provided that the data storage solution can meet the security, reliability, and accessibility requirements for the CAT, including storage of PII data, separately.</p>
      <p id="e1e2b61e-765e-4390-8914-fe734a0c3657">(d) Customer and Account Data</p>
      <p id="25762905-3d47-4364-aceb-d4c59d1df02d">All Bidders proposed solutions consistent with the Customer Information Approach in which broker-dealers would report a unique Firm Designated ID for each Customer to the Plan Processor and the Plan Processor would create and store the CAT Customer-ID without passing this information back to the broker-dealer. The use of existing unique identifiers (such as internal firm customer identifiers) could minimize potentially large overhead in the CAT System that otherwise would be required to create and transmit back to CAT Reporters a CAT System-generated unique identifiers. Allowing multiple identifiers also will be more beneficial to CAT Reporters. This approach would still require mapping of identifiers to connect all trading associated with a single Customer across multiple accounts, but it would also ease the burden on CAT Reporters because each CAT Reporter would report information using existing identifiers it currently uses in its internal systems. Moreover, because the CAT System would not be sending a CAT System-generated Customer-ID back to the CAT Reporters, CAT Reporters would not need to process CAT Customer-IDs assigned by the Plan Processor. This approach would reduce the burden on the CAT Reporters because they would not need to build an additional process to receive a Customer-ID and append that identifier to each order origination, receipt or cancellation. This approach may also help alleviate storage and processing costs and potentially reduce the security risk of transmission of the Customer-ID to the CAT Reporter.</p>
      <p id="65988ff6-e091-4a3e-aea9-4cfbab76947b">The Participants support the use of the Customer Information Approach and included the approach in the Exemptive Request Letter so that the Central Repository could utilize this approach to link Customer and Customer Account Information. The Participants believe this approach would be the most efficient approach for both the Plan Processor and CAT Reporters.</p>
      <p id="883278cd-a6dd-4ecb-b0a5-b2f7860be2c0">(e) Personally Identifying Information (PII)</p>
      <p id="e7917356-6915-4370-a6fb-6591b1b6c847">All Bidders proposed encrypting all PII, both at rest and in motion. This approach allows for secure storage of PII, even if servers should be compromised or data should be leaked. However, encryption can be highly complex to implement effectively (e.g., the poor choice of password salting or an insecure storage of private keys can compromise security, even without knowledge of the system administrator).</p>
      <p id="7ac0f1f6-ee83-4989-b430-666d61b90791">All Bidders also proposed imposing a Role Based Access Control<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-8" NAME="fr_pz80-8">249</a> to PII. These controls would allow for varying levels of access depending on user needs, and would allow compartmentalizing access based on &#8220;need to know.&#8221; However, multiple layers of access can add further complexity to the implementation and use of a system.</p>
      <p id="2320ab47-4737-40f0-8383-12bf7a3dc2d3">Some Bidders also proposed implementing multi-factor authentication<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-9" NAME="fr_pz80-9">250</a>. This greatly enhances security and can prevent a leak of passwords or keys from completely compromising security. However, it increases system overhead, and increases the difficulty of accessing data.</p>
      <p id="751d6e3b-c0e8-4723-b8cc-a9cee7f74307">The Participants are requiring multi-factor authentication and Role Based Access Control for access to PII, separation of PII from other CAT Data, restricted access to PII (only those with a &#8220;need to know&#8221; will have access), and an auditable record of all access to PII data contained in the Central Repository. The Participants believe potential increased costs to the Plan Processor and delays that this could cause to accessing PII are balanced by the need to protect PII.</p>
      <p id="612ba6aa-b654-4830-83f5-8c27224beda9">(f) Data Ingestion Format</p>
      <p id="18ff24a8-b317-466f-acb9-bfbf6aabe09e">Bidders proposed several approaches for the ingestion format for CAT Data: uniform defined format, use of existing messaging protocols or a hybrid approach whereby data can be submitted in a uniform defined format or using existing message protocols. There are benefits to the industry under any of the three formats. A large portion of the industry currently reports to OATS in a uniform defined format. These firms have invested time and resources to develop a process for reporting to OATS. The uniform formats recommended by the Bidders would leverage the OATS format and enhance it to meet the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>. This uniform format, therefore, may reduce the burden on certain CAT Reporters and simplify the process for those CAT Reporters to implement the CAT. However, some firms use message protocols, like FIX, as a standard point of reference with Industry Members that is typically used across the order lifecycle and within a firm&#8217;s order management processes. Leveraging existing messaging protocols could result in quicker implementation times and simplify data aggregation for Participants, CAT Reporters, and the Plan Processor, though it is worth noting that message formats may need to be updated to support CAT Data requirements.</p>
      <p id="87d057a0-2c18-4798-a801-42981af0b42f">The Participants are not mandating the data ingestion format for the CAT. The Participants believe that the nature of the data ingestion is key to the architecture of the CAT. A cost study of members of the Participants did not reveal a strong cost preference for using an existing file format for reporting vs. creating a new format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-10" NAME="fr_pz80-10">251</a> However, FIF did indicate there was an industry preference among its members for using the FIX protocol.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-11" NAME="fr_pz80-11">252</a></p>
      <p id="a9c3f68b-a9ac-45b3-b919-34d97e716e20">(g) Process to Develop the CAT</p>
      <p id="9bda6421-d4c5-4f86-906c-2eb57cdbe0e6">Bidders proposed several processes for development of the CAT: the agile or iterative development model, the waterfall model, and hybrid models that incorporate aspects of both the waterfall and agile methodologies. An agile methodology is an iterative model in which development is staggered and provides for continuous evolution of requirements and solutions. A waterfall model is a sequential process of software development with dedicated phases for Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/ Implementation and Maintenance. The agile or iterative model is flexible to changes and facilitates early delivery of usable software that can be used for testing and feedback, helping to facilitate software that meets users&#8217; needs. However, at the beginning of an agile or iterative development process, it can be difficult to accurately estimate the effort and time required for completion. The waterfall model would provide an up-front estimate of time and effort and would facilitate longer-term planning and coordination among multiple vendors or project streams. However, the waterfall model could be less flexible to changes, particularly changes that occur between design and delivery (and thereby potentially producing software that meets specifications but not user needs).</p>
      <p id="2b0d560c-4e20-4ea3-aba4-2a9f48d3f149">The Participants are not mandating a development process. The Participants believe that either agile or iterative development or waterfall method or even a combination of both methods could be utilized to manage the development of CAT.</p>
      <p id="401dd3c9-edf4-4c15-bdc0-3db7f3a607ab">(h) Industry Testing</p>
      <p id="dacb701b-1710-4169-a04d-9a082f757a09">Bidders also proposed a range of approaches to industry testing, including dedicated environments, re-use of existing environments, scheduled testing events, and ongoing testing.</p>
      <p id="5ffa94ee-b1ab-4d7c-8243-7be8d658ce1b">Dedicated industry test environments could provide the possibility of continuous testing by participants, rather than allow for testing only on scheduled dates. Use of dedicated industry test environments also would not impact other ongoing operations (such as disaster recovery sites). However, developing and maintaining dedicated test environments would entail additional complexity and expense. Such expenses may be highest in hosted architecture systems where dedicated hardware would be needed, but potentially rarely used.</p>
      <p id="e909dfeb-495f-4c71-bc24-5cd9b16576c4">The re-use of existing environments, such as disaster recovery environment, would provide simplicity and lower administrative costs. However, it could impact other ongoing operations, such as disaster recovery.</p>
      <p id="2ea66fe2-7774-45e9-8f58-a2a7a34929e2">Scheduled testing events (which might be held, for example, on weekends only, or on specific dates throughout the year) could provide for more realistic testing by involving multiple market participants. This approach also would not require the test environment to be available at all times. However, scheduled events would not allow users to test on the CAT System until a dedicated time window is open.</p>
      <p id="a441f61b-861f-4266-866b-c0c65718184d">Ongoing testing would allow users to test the CAT System as often as needed. However, this approach would require the test environment to be available at all times. It also may lead to lower levels of test participation at any given time, which may lead to less realistic testing.</p>
      <p id="7916a546-e7ad-47fd-851b-2484301ee5b7">The Participants are requiring that the CAT provide a dedicated test environment that is functionally equivalent to the production environment and available on a 24x6 basis. The Participants believe that an ongoing testing model will be more helpful to the industry because it will provide an environment in which to test any internal system changes or updates that may occur in the course of their business that may affect reporting to the CAT. Additionally, this environment will provide a resource through which the CAT Reporters can continually test any CAT System mandated or rule associated changes to identify and reduce data errors prior to the changes being implemented in the production environment.</p>
      <p id="2a27139d-51e7-48ea-86ec-74e3cb79b7b1">(i) Quality Assurance (QA)</p>
      <p id="79ad9cd5-3867-423c-aa7a-64ef96ec0656">The Participants considered a number of QA approaches and methodologies, informed by the Bidder&#8217;s proposals as well as discussions with the Participants&#8217; own subject matter resources. Some of the approaches considered included &#8220;continuous integration,&#8221; where developer working copies are merged into the master and tested several times a day, test automation, and various industry standards such as ISO 20000/ITIL. The Participants are not mandating a single approach to QA beyond the requirements detailed in the RFP, for which each Bidder provided a detailed approach.</p>
      <p id="2b38fdd2-1593-442d-978c-816f963cc813">One key component of the QA approaches proposed by the Bidders was the staffing levels associated with QA. Initial QA proposals from Bidders included staffing ranges from between 2 and 90 FTEs, although some Bidders indicated that their QA function was directly incorporated into their development function. Some Bidders proposed allocating QA resources after the third month. A larger number of QA resources may facilitate structured, in-depth testing and validation of the CAT System. However, a larger set of QA resources could lead to higher fixed costs and administrative overhead.</p>
      <p id="2b8e76d0-7c24-4c3f-8d8a-0dcedb326621">The Participants are not mandating the size for QA staffing; however, the Participants will consider each Bidder&#8217;s QA staffing proposals in the context of the overall Bid, and the selected Bidder must ensure that its QA staffing is sufficient to perform the activities required by the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants believe the QA staffing numbers varied in the Bids because they are largely dependent on both the staffing philosophy of the Bidder as well as the organizational structure for the proposed Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="e4730ea5-f34d-40f6-a9b8-5774545576aa">(j) User Support and Help Desk</p>
      <p id="5b13cae0-3acd-4a11-8100-700b71c0eb73">The RFP required that the CAT Help Desk be available on a 24x7 basis, and that it be able to manage 2,500 calls per month. To comply with these requirements, Bidders proposed user support staffing ranges from five to 36 FTEs. They also proposed dedicated support teams and support teams shared with other groups.</p>
      <p id="9048e25b-5e22-41f9-b94f-a5453c33c20a">A larger number of FTE user support staff could provide a higher level and quality of support. However, a higher number of staff would impose additional overhead and administrative costs. Additionally, as the support organization grows, it may become less closely integrated with the development team, which could decrease support effectiveness.</p>
      <p id="34599ca9-cb90-4cb2-a662-8c8c5dfb3f31">A dedicated CAT support team would facilitate deep knowledge of the CAT System and industry practices. However, it would create additional overhead and costs. Additionally, management of support teams may not be the managing firm&#8217;s primary business, which could lead to inefficiencies. A support staff shared with non-CAT teams could provide for increased efficiency, if the team has greater experience in support more broadly. However, support resources may not have the depth of knowledge that dedicated support teams could be expected to develop.</p>
      <p id="485fdfbd-9822-408d-a570-f6f3a94e21a5">The Participants are not requiring specific FTEs for user support staffing; however, the Participants will consider each Bidder&#8217;s user support staffing proposals in the context of the overall Bid, and the selected Bidder must ensure that its staffing is sufficient to perform the activities required by the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants believe that the number of FTEs varied in the Bids because they are largely dependent on both the staffing philosophy of the Bidder as well as the organizational structure for the proposed Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="e94af394-60a7-423e-bb37-23b88cf442f0">Some Bidders proposed a US-based help desk, while others proposed basing it offshore. A U.S.-based help desk could facilitate a higher level of service, and could provide a greater level of security (given the sensitive nature of the CAT). However, a U.S.-based help desk may have greater labor costs. An offshore help desk would potentially have lower labor costs, but could provide (actual or perceived) lower level of service, and could raise security concerns (particularly where the help desk resources are employed by a third-party).</p>
      <p id="97440f4a-832b-4680-a714-d946560fda7c">The Participants are not requiring a specific location for the help desk. The Participants believe that as long as the Bidder&#8217;s solution meets the service and security requirements of the CAT, it is not necessary to prescribe the location.</p>
      <p id="cbac7de5-5a5e-4dfe-b51a-3cc4be59d7a2">(k) CAT User Management</p>
      <p id="d3ff715c-4146-400a-aed0-8ef14f02690e">Bidders proposed several approaches to user management<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-8" NAME="fr_pz83-8">253</a>: help desk creation of user accounts, user (e.g., broker-dealer) creation of accounts, and multi-role. Help desk creation of accounts would allow for greater oversight and validation of user creation. However, it would increase administrative costs, particularly in the early stages of the CAT (as an FTE must setup each user). User creation of accounts would require lower staffing levels but would provide less oversight and validation of user creation.</p>
      <p id="7c4a1f4c-0f9a-4a1c-ac2b-c238b5d1d0f9">A multi-role approach would allow for a blended approach in which the Plan Processor could, for example, set up an administrator at each broker-dealer, and then allow the broker-dealer to set up additional accounts as needed. This approach could allow users with different levels of access to be provisioned differently, with those requiring greater oversight being provisioned manually. However, it would add complexity to the user creation system, and would provide less oversight and validation than would a fully manual system.</p>
      <p id="85cdb339-98ca-49b0-8db0-46ff962b9b6f">For CAT Reporters entering information into the CAT, the Participants are requiring that each user be validated by the Plan Processor to set-up access to the system. However, for staff at regulators that will be accessing the information for regulatory purposes only, the Plan Processor can establish a set-up administrator who has the ability to provide access to other users within its organization. However, such administrators cannot set up access for PII information. Staff at regulators who need access to PII information must go through an authentication process directly with the Plan Processor. The Participants believe that this approach balances the demand on the staff at the Plan Processor with the need to ensure proper oversight and validation for users of the CAT.</p>
      <p id="0d230cf2-d42e-4618-9eb9-f44d59b8f417">(l) Required Reportable Order Events</p>
      <p id="df5b66d8-6eaf-48d2-a90e-5e5f5e52e8ba">The Participants considered multiple order event types for inclusion in the Plan. Of the order event types considered, the results order event type and the CAT feedback order event were not required. The Participants determined that a results order event type would not provide additional value over a &#8220;daisy chain&#8221; linkage method. A CAT feedback order event can be generated by the Plan Processor, thereby removing the reporting burden from reporting firms. Therefore the Participants are not requiring CAT Reporters to provide data for these two event types to the CAT. The required reportable order events are listed in Section 6.3(d).</p>
      <p id="1636489f-1522-4c92-ab41-6c1e395b953c">(m) Data Retention Requirements</p>
      <p id="6394b2d0-b10c-45ba-a718-a93f9af424f5"><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(e)(8)</a> requires data to be available and searchable for a period of not less than five years. Broker-dealers are currently required to retain data for six years under the <a href="">Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(a)</a>.</p>
      <p id="175e6ea5-6b68-4622-9067-4912b56686cc">The Participants support the use of a six year retention timeframe as it complies with <a href="">Exchange Act Rule 17a-4(a)</a>. The Participants are requiring data for six years to be kept online in an easily accessible format to enable regulators to have access to six years of audit trail materials for purposes of its regulation.</p>
      <p id="32b9efdb-d672-41bf-accb-0a9234f35a34">The Participants understand that requiring this sixth year of data storage may increase the cost to run the CAT; however, they believe the incremental cost would be outweighed by the needs of regulators to have access to the information. An analysis of the six Shortlisted Bidder proposals indicated that the average expected year-on-year annual cost increase during years four and five (i.e., once all reporters were reporting to the Central Repository) was approximately 4%. Extending this increase to another year would result in incremental annual costs to the Plan Processor ranging from approximately $1.15 million to $4.44 million depending upon the Bidder. Based on the assumption that the cumulative annual cost increase from year five to year six will also be 4% (including all the components provided by the Bidders in their respective cost schedules<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz84-9" NAME="fr_pz84-9">254</a>), the maximum cost increase for data retention for an additional year would be 4%.</p>
      <p id="f0380d34-a943-432a-85c0-392171b73e56">(n) Data Feed Connectivity</p>
      <p id="61a5b3fd-6888-4af2-9828-05c2cb0954a3">Bidders proposed either real-time SIP connectivity or end-of-day batch SIP connectivity. Real-time SIP connectivity would provide for more rapid access to SIP Data, but may require additional processing support to deal with out-of-sequence or missing records. End-of-day batch SIP connectivity provides the possibility of simpler implementation, but data from SIPs would not be available in the CAT until after overnight processing. Because CAT Reporters are only required to report order information on a next-day basis, the Participants are not requiring that the Plan Processor have real-time SIP connectivity.</p>
      <p id="24cf79d0-c7e5-4865-85fd-fac2a8553cc1">(o) Disaster Recovery</p>
      <p id="25b16416-2c69-4f00-acb1-d37d57a07ec5">Participants discussed two commonly accepted structures for disaster recovery: hot-hot<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-5" NAME="fr_pz85-5">255</a> and hot-warm<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-6" NAME="fr_pz85-6">256</a>. While hot-hot allows for immediate cutover, the Participants agreed that real-time synchronization was not required, but rather that data must be kept synchronized to satisfy disaster recovery timing requirements (e.g., 48 hour cutover). A hot-warm structure meets the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, and costs for hot-hot were considered to be higher than hot-warm. Therefore, the Participants are requiring a hot-warm disaster recovery structure, provided it meets the requirements set forth in Appendix D, BCP / DR Process.</p>
      <p id="0941a7d2-a45b-4b62-aec7-8670eed5c588">(p) Synchronization of Business Clocks</p>
      <p id="c2a6c865-8ba5-4967-8151-462453133b9c">The Participants considered multiple levels of precision for the clock synchronization standard set forth in the plan, ranging from 1 second (s) to 100 microseconds (&#956;s). The Participants determined based on their expertise and feedback from industry that an initial clock synchronization of 50 milliseconds (ms) would be the most practical and effective choice and represents the current industry standard. Pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(d)</a>, the initial standard of 50ms will be subject to annual analysis as to whether or not a more stringent clock synchronization tolerance could be implemented consistent with changes in industry standards.</p>
      <p id="a1d2afea-76c5-4914-8283-599e47acd68c">In order to identify the industry standard the Participants and Industry Members reviewed their own internal technology around Network Time Protocol (&#8220;NTP&#8221;) and Precision Time Protocol (&#8220;PTP&#8221;),<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-7" NAME="fr_pz85-7">257</a> potentially used in conjunction with Global Positioning System (&#8220;GPS&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-8" NAME="fr_pz85-8">258</a> In reviewing internal infrastructure, the Participants and Industry Members noted that the majority of firms had indicated that they leveraged at least NTP clock synchronization technology. In addition, the FIF conducted a clock synchronization survey<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-9" NAME="fr_pz85-9">259</a> (&#8220;FIF Clock Offset Survey&#8221;) of 28 firms to identify costs and challenges associated with clock synchronization tolerances of 50ms, 5ms, 1ms, and 100&#956;s. The FIF Clock Offset Survey indicated that 93% of responding firms leverage NTP technology, while fewer than half of responding firms use SNTP, PTP, or GPS. In reviewing the standards for NTP technology, the Participants determined that this technology can accommodate a 50ms tolerance. In addition, the FIF Clock Offset Survey demonstrated that 60% of responding firms currently synchronize their clocks with an offset of 50ms or greater, with approximately 20% of responding firms currently using an offset of 50ms. Only 18% of responding firms used a clock offset of 30ms or less. In light of these reviews and the survey data, the Participants concluded that a clock offset of 50ms represents an aggressive, but achievable, industry standard.</p>
      <p id="54c86c13-cffe-47f5-b8d0-14325bb21637">In addition to determining current industry clock offset standards used in the industry, the FIF Clock Offset Survey indicated that the costs to survey respondents were as follows:<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz86-7" NAME="fr_pz86-7">260</a></p>
      
      <p id="ae9a66f9-5758-4a9e-8326-76691c6d832c">As indicated in the above table, annual maintenance costs of survey respondents for a 50ms standard would be on average 31% higher than current costs, and would escalate to 102%, 123%, and 242% increases over current maintenance costs as clock synchronization standards move to 5ms, 1ms, and 100&#956;s respectively, indicating that maintenance costs rapidly escalate as clock synchronization standards increase beyond 50ms. Survey respondents also indicated that increasing clock synchronization requirements would require escalating technology changes, including significant hardware changes (such as installation of dedicated GPS or other hardware clocks and network architecture redesign), migration to new time synchronization standards, and widespread upgrades of operating systems and databases currently in use. For example, to achieve a 5ms clock offset would require firms to install GPS clocks in all locations and migrate from NTP to PTP. The Participants believe, based on the FIF Clock Offset Survey, that fewer than half of firms currently leverage GPS technology or PTP for clock synchronization.</p>
      <p id="ec2dbacc-e21d-4a97-a857-1cb1977ca002">As noted in Article VI, Section 6.8, the Participants, working with the Processor&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer, shall annually evaluate and make recommendations as to whether industry standards have evolved such that changes to the clock synchronization standards should be changed. It is the belief of the Participants that, while setting an initial clock synchronization of 5ms lower than 50ms may be achievable, it does not represent current industry standard and there may be challenges with small broker-dealers&#8217; potentially substantial costs. However, once both large and small broker-dealers begin reporting data to the Central Repository, and as increased time synchronization standards become more mature, the Participants will assess the ability to tighten the clock synchronization standards to reflect changes in industry standards in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>.</p>

      <p id="83b144cc-41bb-4622-956e-e8577f3716d4">Appendix D, CAT NMS Plan Processor Requirements, outlines minimum functional and technical requirements established by the Participants of the CAT NMS Plan for the Plan Processor. Given the technical nature of many of these requirements, it is anticipated, as technology evolves, that some may change over time. The Participants recognize that effective oversight of, and a collaborative working relationship with, the Plan Processor will be critical to ensure the CAT achieves its intended purpose, namely enhanced investor protection, in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The Participants also recognize that maintaining the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the CAT requires flexibility to respond to technological innovations and market changes. For example, these minimum functional and technical requirements allow the Plan Processor flexibility to make certain changes to the Technical Specifications, while limiting others to the Operating Committee, and anticipate agreement between the Operating Committee and the Plan Processor on SLAs relating to, among other things, development, change management, and implementation processes and timelines. Maintaining such flexibility to adapt in these and other areas relating to the development and operation of the CAT is a foundational principle of this Appendix D.</p>

      <p id="979364aa-7285-48de-8b64-0ee6d31f2785">The Central Repository must be designed and sized to ingest, process, and store large volumes of data. The technical infrastructure needs to be scalable, adaptable to new requirements and operable within a rigorous processing and control environment. As a result, the technical infrastructure will require an environment with significant throughput capabilities, advanced data management services and robust processing architecture.</p>
      <p id="92cd258f-e3cb-4859-bf8e-7c22f27356bd">The technical architecture must be scalable and able to readily expand its capacity to process significant increases in data volumes beyond the baseline capacity. The baseline capacity requirements are defined in this document. Once the CAT NMS Plan is approved, the Operating Committee will define the baseline metrics on an ongoing basis. CAT capacity planning must include SIP, OPRA and exchange capacity and growth forecasts. The initial baseline capacity requirements will be based on twice (2X) the historical peaks for the most recent six years, and the Plan Processor must be prepared to handle peaks in volume that could exceed this baseline for short periods. The SLA(s) will outline details of the technical performance and scalability requirements, and will be specifically targeted to the selected Bidder&#8217;s solution.</p>

      <p id="23d0c3b1-4ec5-43b4-aded-d92e23b596b0">The Plan Processor must develop data management policies and procedures to govern and manage CAT Data, reference data, and metadata contained in and used by the Central Repository.</p>
      <p id="f2b0ea0f-2006-4328-9299-18e007123a42">The CAT must capture, store, and maintain current and historical reference data information. This master / reference database will include data elements such as, but not limited to, SRO-assigned market participant identifiers, product type, trading unit size, trade / quote minimum price variation, corporate actions, symbology changes, and changes in listings market center. The Plan Processor must support bi-temporal milestones (e.g., Effective Date and as-of-date) of the reference data.</p>
      <p id="d37d64ea-d377-47b9-bbb0-c9200d1f7c6b">CAT Reporters will submit data to the Central Repository with the listing exchange symbology format. The Central Repository must use the listing exchange symbology format for output of the linked data. Instrument validation must be included in the processing of data submitted by CAT Reporters.</p>
      <p id="4934bf42-5255-4609-a216-15d1343d7d1d">The Central Repository must be able to link instrument data across any time period so that data can be properly displayed and linked regardless of changes to issue symbols or market class. The Plan Processor is required to create and maintain a symbol history and mapping table, as well as to provide a tool that will display a complete issue symbol history that will be accessible to CAT Reporters, Participants and the SEC. In addition, the Plan Processor will be required to create a start-of-day (&#8220;SOD&#8221;) and end-of-day (&#8220;EOD&#8221;) CAT reportable list of securities for use by CAT Reporters. This list must be available online and in a machine readable (e.g., .csv) format by 6 a.m. on each Trading Day.</p>
      <p id="23445afd-92a4-4b45-876e-52bbb4a5543d">Queries, reports, and searches for data that span dates where there are changes to reference data must automatically include data within the requested date range. For example, if a query is run for a symbol that had three issue symbol changes during the time window of the query parameters, the result set must automatically include data for all three symbols that were in use during the time window of the query.</p>
      <p id="a0baa098-f4e4-441e-b3f8-885066933750">The Plan Processor must also develop an end-to-end process and framework for technical, business and operational metadata.</p>

      <p id="e9462d32-a73f-4736-be32-cf4126ffdc7b">The Plan Processor will be responsible for developing detailed data and interface specifications for data to be submitted by CAT Reporters. These specifications will be contained in the Technical Specifications, the initial version of which will be presented to the Operating Committee for approval. The Technical Specifications must be designed to capture all of the data elements required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a>, as well as other information the Participants determine necessary to facilitate elimination of reporting systems that the CAT may cause to be redundant, such as EBS and OATS. In the future, new data sources such as public news may be added to the specifications.</p>
      <p id="00f02a2e-e03f-4c27-8050-7bc843464471">CAT Reporters and Data Submitters will transmit data in an electronic data format(s) that will be defined by the Plan Processor. The Technical Specifications must include details for connectivity and electronic submission, transmission, retransmission and processing. It is possible that more than one format will be defined to support the various senders throughout the industry.</p>
      <p id="83f29a25-063e-4c25-a252-5a202ab56821">The Participants anticipate that some broker-dealers will not directly report to the CAT but will rely on other organizations to report on their behalf. However, the CAT will need to have the flexibility to adapt on a timely basis to changes in the number of entities that report CAT Data.</p>

      <p id="3815683e-cdbd-4e91-a9f5-054cbee7c169">The Plan Processor must have appropriate solutions and controls in place to ensure data confidentiality and security during all communication between CAT Reporters and Data Submitters and the Plan Processor, data extraction, manipulation and transformation, loading to and from the Central Repository and data maintenance by the CAT System. The Plan Processor must address security controls for data retrieval and query reports by Participant and the SEC. The solution must provide appropriate tools, logging, auditing and access controls for all components of the CAT System, such as but not limited to access to the Central Repository, access for CAT Reporters, access to rejected data, processing status and CAT Reporter performance and comparison statistics.</p>
      <p id="469c27ea-c4c7-48de-867c-b3b75d3542a8">The Plan Processor must provide to the Operating Committee a comprehensive security plan that covers all components of the CAT System, including physical assets and personnel, and the training of all persons who have access to the Central Repository consistent with Article VI, Section 6.1(m). The security plan must be updated annually. The security plan must include an overview of the Plan Processor&#8217;s network security controls, processes and procedures pertaining to the CAT Systems. Details of the security plan must document how the Plan Processor will protect, monitor and patch the environment; assess it for vulnerabilities as part of a managed process, as well as the process for response to security incidents and reporting of such incidents. The security plan must address physical security controls for corporate, data center, and leased facilities where Central Repository data is transmitted or stored. The Plan Processor must have documented &#8220;hardening baselines&#8221; for systems that will store, process, or transmit CAT Data or PII data.</p>
      <p id="7d83de87-56ad-4baa-babb-ec950d0a2299">4.1.1 Connectivity and Data Transfer</p>
      <p id="e456f8d2-8772-4382-b29b-9e5bb80fd585">The CAT System(s) must have encrypted internet connectivity. CAT Reporters must connect to the CAT infrastructure using secure methods such as private lines or (for smaller broker-dealers) Virtual Private Network connections over public lines. Remote access to the Central Repository must be limited to authorized Plan Processor staff and must use secure multi-factor authentication that meets or exceeds the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (&#8220;FFIEC&#8221;) security guidelines surrounding authentication best practices.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-9" NAME="fr_pz98-9">264</a></p>
      <p id="6df4b2de-95f2-423d-a291-a2f96e3bfa83">The CAT databases must be deployed within the network infrastructure so that they are not directly accessible from external end-user networks. If public cloud infrastructures are used, virtual private networking and firewalls/access control lists or equivalent controls such as private network segments or private tenant segmentation must be used to isolate CAT Data from unauthenticated public access.</p>
      <p id="31cbb2d8-17d9-46eb-acb4-7df736c54714">4.1.2 Data Encryption</p>
      <p id="39861d2a-45f6-45e2-a407-e6f1e953ade6">All CAT Data must be encrypted at rest and in flight using industry standard best practices (e.g., SSL/TLS) including archival data storage methods such as tape backup. Symmetric key encryption must use a minimum key size of 128 bits or greater (e.g., AES-128), larger keys are preferable. Asymmetric key encryption (e.g., PGP) for exchanging data between Data Submitters and the Central Repository is desirable.</p>
      <p id="7e1d4cd0-7f33-4453-a63f-6b0363cb4698">Storage of unencrypted PII data is not permissible. PII encryption methodology must include a secure documented key management strategy such as the use of HSM(s). The Plan Processor must describe how PII encryption is performed and the key management strategy (e.g., AES-256, 3DES).</p>
      <p id="4eaaa210-39cb-4fce-b2d4-fb9299f18ea0">If public cloud managed services are used that would inherently have access to the data (e.g., BigQuery, S3, Redshift), then the key management surrounding the encryption of that data must be documented (particularly whether the cloud provider manages the keys, or if the Plan Processor maintains that control). Auditing and real-time monitoring of the service for when cloud provider personnel are able to access/decrypt CAT Data must be documented, as well as a response plan to address instances where unauthorized access to CAT Data is detected. Key management/rotation/revocation strategies and key chain of custody must also be documented in detail.</p>
      <p id="03acdfe2-1398-424f-b740-f034bf36a313">4.1.3 Data Storage and Environment</p>
      <p id="bbedc680-9f7f-40e3-841b-72a7f8bb765d">Data centers housing CAT Systems (whether public or private) must, at a minimum, be AICPA SOC 2 certified by a qualified third-party auditor that is not an affiliate of any of the Participants or the CAT Processor. The frequency of the audit must be at least once per year.</p>
      <p id="c0a61785-cc49-4828-ae54-fd402cfd6b2b">CAT compute infrastructure may not be commingled with other non-regulatory systems (or tenets, in the case of public cloud infrastructure). Systems hosting the CAT processing for any applications must be segmented from other systems as far as is feasible on a network level (firewalls, security groups, ACL&#8217;s, VLAN&#8217;s, authentication proxies/bastion hosts and similar). In the case of systems using inherently shared infrastructure/storage (e.g., public cloud storage services), an encryption/key management/access control strategy that effectively renders the data private must be documented.</p>
      <p id="e1754cc1-7116-49c7-ba04-fce1d91cb52b">The Plan Processor must include penetration testing and an application security code audit by a reputable (and named) third party prior to launch as well as periodically as defined in the SLA(s). Reports of the audit will be provided to the Operating Committee as well as remediation plan for identified issues. The penetration test reviews of the Central Repository&#8217;s network, firewalls, and development, testing and production systems should help the CAT evaluate the system&#8217;s security and resiliency in the face of attempted and successful systems intrusions.</p>

The BCP must address the protection of data, service for the data submissions, processing, data access, support functions and operations. In the context of this document, BCP generally refers to how the business activities will continue in the event of a widespread disruption and the DR requirements refer to how the CAT infrastructure will be designed to support a full data center outage. In addition, the Plan Processor must have SLAs in place to govern redundancy (i.e., no single point of failure) of critical aspects of the CAT System (e.g., electrical feeds, network connectivity, redundant processors, storage units, etc.) and must have an architecture to support and meet the SLA requirements. Any SLAs between the Plan Processor and third parties must be approved by the Operating Committee.</p>

      <p id="5b85c388-483e-408e-9907-95bd3feffb8a">5.3 Business Continuity Planning</p>
      <p id="8f84444d-e9d0-4062-a7b2-b4fc9bb2b105">The Plan Processor will design a BCP that supports a continuation of the business activities required of the CAT in the event of a widespread disruption.</p>
      <p id="bbc72568-6d75-43f2-89d6-f69d313ce867">With respect to the team supporting CAT business operations, a secondary site must be selected that is capable of housing the critical staff necessary for CAT business operations. The site must be fully equipped to allow for immediate use. The selection of the site must take into account diversity in utility and telecommunications infrastructure as well as the ability for CAT staff to access the site in the event of transit shutdowns, closure of major roadways and other significant disruptions that may affect staff. Planning should consider operational disruption involving significant unavailability of staff.</p>
      <p id="0401d315-406c-4d92-9cd5-89fdd6b0bd48">A bi-annual test of CAT operations where CAT staff operates the facility from the secondary site is required. This will ensure that phone systems, operational tools and other help desk functions all work as expected and the Plan Processor still functions as usual even in the event of a disruption.</p>
      <p id="68293825-8416-4a2b-9194-ec8a242b79fa">CAT operations staff must maintain, and annually test, remote access capabilities to ensure smooth operations during a site un-availability event. Certain critical staff may be required to report directly to the secondary office site. However, an effective telecommuting solution must be in place for all critical CAT operations staff. Furthermore, any telecommuting strategy must require a remote desktop style solution where CAT operations and data consoles remain at the primary data center and must further ensure that CAT Data may not be downloaded to equipment that is not CAT-owned and compliant with CAT security requirements.</p>
      <p id="d0b2b853-2deb-4a40-85d8-f3ea3c68c00d">The BCP must identify critical third party dependencies. The Plan Processor will coordinate with critical suppliers regarding their arrangements and involve these parties in tests on an annual basis. Critical third party firms may be required to provide evidence of their BCP capabilities and testing.</p>
      <p id="5613a5d9-5f58-49c0-b42a-224e1c5ca7fc">The Plan Processor must conduct third party risk assessments at regular intervals to verify that security controls implemented are in accordance with NIST SP 800-53. These risk assessments must include assessment scheduling, questionnaire completion and reporting. The Plan Processor should provide assessment reports to the Operating Committee.</p>
      <p id="c91054da-030e-4130-bb67-e129a55c31db">The Plan Processor will develop and annually test a detailed crisis management plan to be invoked following certain agreed disruptive circumstances.</p>

      <p id="498b51a9-27a7-43ad-a9e8-e8a312f8f6f3">The Plan Processor will implement a DR capability that will ensure no loss of data and will support the data availability requirements and anticipated volumes of the CAT.</p>
      <p id="226c7a02-39a0-4fd1-b831-26ede7e2e952">A secondary processing site must be capable of recovery and restoration of services at the secondary site within a minimum of 48 hours, but with the goal of achieving next day recovery after a disaster event. The selection of the secondary site must consider sites with geographic diversity that do not rely on the same utility, telecom and other critical infrastructure services. The processing sites for disaster recovery and business continuity must adhere to the &#8220;Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System.&#8221;</p>
      <p id="233fe4f2-6167-478a-9dc0-0dbc7b3986d1">The secondary site must have the same level of availability / capacity / throughput and security (physical and logical) as the primary site. The requirement implies and expects that fully redundant connectivity between the primary and secondary processing sites be established and fully available. Further, given this recovery window, this connectivity must be used to replicate repositories between the primary and secondary sites. Finally, CAT Reporter and Data Submitter submissions must be replicated to the secondary site for possible replay if recent replications are incomplete. Replication must occur as deliveries complete to ensure that a widespread communications failure will have minimal impact to the state of the secondary site.</p>
      <p id="a32f0faa-2185-4d0b-b3c9-593cb064c250">On an annual basis, the Plan Processor must execute an industry DR test, which must include Plan Participants and a critical mass of non-Plan Participant CAT Reporters and Data Submitters. The tests must be structured such that all CAT Reporters and other Data Submitters can upload to the DR site and the data be ingested by the CAT Data loaders. All DR tests are required to realistically reflect the worst-case scenario.</p>
      <p id="9952fe0a-b0dc-49ef-a9fb-fe99a438ba9a">Failover processes must be transparent to CAT Reporters, as well as failback. In the event of a site failover, CAT Reporters must be able to deliver their daily files without changing configuration. This avoids requiring all CAT Reporters to update configurations, which is an error-prone effort.</p>
      <p id="07ac09e7-4e5b-49bc-8f3c-effe3c0381a2">After a DR event, the primary processing site must be made available as quickly as possible. For short duration DR events, the primary site must be returned to primary within 48 hours after the DR event. Longer duration outages will have differing SLAs. The DR plan must include designs that allow the re-introduction of the primary site or the introduction of a new primary site as the event dictates and an indication of the time required for this re-introduction.</p>

In addition, the tool must indicate in the search results whether the retrieved data was linked or unlinked (e.g., using a flag). In addition, the online targeted query tool must not display any PII data. Instead, it will display existing non-PII unique identifiers (e.g., Customer-ID or Firm Designated ID). The PII corresponding to these identifiers can be gathered using the PII workflow described in Appendix D, Data Security, PII Data Requirements. The Plan Processor must define the maximum number of records that can be viewed in the online tool as well as the maximum number of records that can be downloaded. Users must have the ability to download the results to .csv, .txt, and other formats, as applicable. These files will also need to be available in a compressed format (e.g., .zip, .gz). Result sets that exceed the maximum viewable or download limits must return to users a message informing them of the size of the result set and the option to choose to have the result set returned via an alternate method.</p>

      <p id="6fda6353-751d-45e8-8a39-fc8eba325e9e">For targeted search criteria, the minimum acceptable response times will be increments of less than one minute. For the complex queries that either scan large volumes of data (e.g., multiple trade dates) or return large result sets (&gt;1M records), the response time must generally be available within 24 hours of the submission of the request. Regardless of the complexity of the criteria used within the online query tool, any query request for data within one business date of a 12-month period must return results within 3 hours.</p>

      <p id="c839642f-0254-4b75-a727-f40e0f6a23a7">The online targeted query tool architecture must include an automated application-level resource management component. This feature must manage query requests to balance the workload to ensure the response times for targeted and complex queries meet the defined response times. The resource management function will categorize and prioritize query requests based on the input parameters, complexity of the query, and the volume of data to be parsed in the query. Additionally, the source of the query may also be used to prioritize the processing. The Plan Processor must provide details on the prioritization plan of the defined solution for online query requests.</p>

      <p id="ce01d418-6909-4532-8bf1-a285e1be677b">Access to CAT Data is limited to authorized regulatory users from the Participants and the SEC. Authorized regulators from the Participants and the SEC may access all CAT Data, with the exception of PII data. A subset of the authorized regulators from the Participants and the SEC will have permission to access and view PII data. The Plan Processor must work with the Participants and SEC to implement an administrative and authorization process to provide regulator access. The Plan Processor must have procedures and a process in place to verify the list of active users on a regular basis.</p>
      <p id="e2640f5e-19d9-44ea-8088-3f2d190114f0">A two-factor authentication is required for access to CAT Data. PII data must not be available via the online targeted query tool or the user-defined direct query interface.</p>

      <p id="651ce82b-c3f5-4306-bdf9-4dfb9144bd2f">The Central Repository must provide for direct queries, bulk extraction, and download of data for all regulatory users. Both the user-defined direct queries and bulk extracts will be used by regulators to deliver large sets of data that can then be used in internal surveillance or market analysis applications. The data extracts must use common industry formats.</p>
      <p id="3a9f2150-4371-4321-9e53-44d8c61f3296">Direct queries must not return or display PII data. Instead, they will return existing non-PII unique identifiers (e.g., Customer-ID or Firm Designated ID). The PII corresponding to these identifiers can be gathered using the PII workflow described in Appendix D, Data Security, PII Data Requirements.</p>
      <p id="0f986663-89c9-421c-9364-afceb7c8b686">Participants and regulators must have the ability to create, save, and schedule dynamic queries that will run directly against processed and/or unlinked CAT Data. The examples below demonstrate robust usage of the CAT Data to perform a variety of complex query, surveillance, and market analysis use cases. User-defined direct queries will be used to perform tasks such as market reconstruction, behavioral analysis, and cross-market surveillance.</p>
      <p id="ac19058b-08ab-4cd5-8ec4-265b44f43ec5">The method(s) for providing this capability is dependent upon the architecture of the CAT and will be defined by the final solution. The CAT cannot be web-based due to the volumes of data that could be extracted.</p>
      <p id="67a8f55c-82c3-4e88-9736-b5637106e9b3">The Participants are agnostic as to how user-defined direct queries or bulk extracts are implemented as long as the solution provides an open API that allows regulators to use analytic tools (e.g., R, SAS, Python, Tableau) and can use ODBC/JDBC drivers to access the CAT Data. Queries invoked through the open API must be auditable. The CAT System must contain the same level of control, monitoring, logging and reporting as the online targeted query tool. The Plan Processor may define a limited set of basic required fields (e.g., date and at least one other field such as symbol, CAT-Reporter ID, or CAT-Customer-ID) that regulators must use in direct dynamic queries.</p>
      <p id="01cdeb9a-99aa-49b7-9ff2-1a0aa531cf23">The Plan Processor must provide procedures and training to regulators that will use the direct query feature. The Plan Processor may choose to require that user-defined direct query users participate in mandatory training sessions.</p>
      <p id="2b9c86f0-1596-4389-8edc-e8a32c7dfe09">The bulk extract feature will replace the current Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG) ECAT and COATS compliance data files that are currently processed and provided to Participants for use in surveillance applications. These files are used extensively across all Participants in a variety of surveillance applications and are a critical data input to many surveillance algorithms. With the initial implementation of the CAT, opportunities exist to improve the content and depth of information available in these data files. The Plan Processor will need to work with ISG to define new layouts that will include additional data elements that will be available in the CAT Data.</p>
      <p id="ea82467a-9420-47a8-ad3f-d7e2680004cf">The Plan Processor is responsible for providing data models and data dictionaries for all processed and unlinked CAT Data.</p>

The reports would be predefined based on requirements developed by Participants and the SEC. Due to the added complexity and the lack of quantifiable use cases, the Participants determined that this was something that may be useful in the future but not at the initial implementation and launch of the CAT. This will be reassessed when broker-dealers begin submitting data to the CAT.</p>
      <p id="6c2c4c81-6635-49bf-91d2-2b1eb2ad8ae5">It is envisioned that non-Participant CAT Reporters will be unable to access their data submissions through bulk data exports with the initial implementation of CAT.

      <p id="9d38b59d-1b49-4e6a-8fd5-76b05a9c3455">As a fundamental component of this program, the Plan Processor will identify on a daily basis all CAT Reporters exceeding the maximum allowable Error Rate established by the Participants. The Error Rate will initially be set by the CAT NMS Plan, and will be reviewed and adjusted on an ongoing basis by the Operating Committee. Error Rates will be based on timeliness, correctness, and linkages.</p>
      <p id="3a1129fa-9ca4-433c-a6ae-947dfecc4999">The Plan Processor will, on an ongoing basis, analyze reporting statistics and Error Rates and recommend to Participants proposed changes to the maximum allowable Error Rates established by the Participants. All CAT Reporters exceeding this threshold will be notified that they have exceeded the maximum allowable Error Rate and will be informed of the specific reporting requirements that they did not fully meet (e.g., timeliness or rejections).</p>
      <p id="1040d8e5-2f2d-49de-b58a-a132a5b17375">The Plan Processor will develop and publish CAT Reporter compliance report cards on a periodic basis to assist CAT Reporters in monitoring overall compliance with CAT reporting requirements. The Plan Processor will also recommend criteria and processes by which CAT Reporters will be fined for inaccurate, incomplete, or late submissions.

The Participants note that CAT Reporters using third party service providers to submit information on their behalf would still be responsible for all the data submitted on their behalf. The term &#8220;CAT Reporters&#8221; is generally used to refer to those parties that are required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> and the CAT NMS Plan to submit data to the CAT (i.e., national securities exchanges, national securities associations, and members thereof). The term &#8220;Data Submitters&#8221; includes those third-parties that may submit data to the CAT on behalf of CAT Reporters as well as outside parties that are not required to submit data to the CAT but from which the CAT may receive data (e.g., SIPs). Thus, all CAT Reporters are Data Submitters, but not all Data Submitters are CAT Reporters.</p>

To ensure the completeness and accuracy of Customer information and associations, in addition to daily updates, broker-dealers would be required to submit periodic full refreshes of Customer information to the CAT. The scope of the &#8220;full&#8221; Customer information refresh would need to be further defined, with the assistance of the Plan Processor, to determine the extent to which inactive or otherwise terminated accounts would need to be reported.</p>

CAT Reporters will be required to meet separate compliance thresholds, which will be a CAT Reporter-specific rate that may be used as the basis for further review or investigation into CAT Reporter performance (the &#8220;Compliance Thresholds&#8221;). Compliance Thresholds will compare a CAT Reporter&#8217;s error rate to the aggregate Error Rate over a period of time to be defined by the Operating Committee. See infra note 109 and accompanying text (discussing Compliance Thresholds). A CAT Reporter&#8217;s performance with respect to the Compliance Threshold will not signify, as a matter of law, that such CAT Reporter has violated <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> or the rules of any Participant concerning the CAT.</p>

Error Rates are calculated for reporting groups as a whole, not for individual firms. Individual firms within a reporting group may have higher or lower Error Rates, though they would still be subject to any penalties or fines for excessive Error Rates to be defined by the Operating Committee. Additionally, this Error Rate will be considered for the purpose of reporting metrics to the SEC and the Operating Committee and individual firms will need to maintain Compliance Thresholds as described below.</p>

Participants do note, however, that as part of the Costs to CAT Reporters Study, respondents were solicited to provide a cost for FTEs. Based on responses, the estimated annual cost per FTE would be $210,000 for large firms and $167,000 for small firms. Applying these estimates instead of the Commission&#8217;s assumed annual cost would lead to dollar costs for FTEs on the order of half as large as reported here.</p>

      <p>193 One anonymous small firm in the sample reported a total current regulatory reporting cost of $14 million. The Participants are not in a position to verify this number or determine whether it is due to an erroneous response (e.g., the respondent may not have recognized that the study collected responses to the cost questions in $1,000 increments). Therefore, Participants believe median numbers might better represent the typical costs across large and small firms instead of reported averages.</p>

The t-test is unable to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., that the difference in costs between the two approaches is not distinguishable from zero) at the 0.05% level. The t-test rejects the null hypothesis for estimates of hardware / software costs, FTE costs, vendor costs, and total costs. The t-test also rejects any significant difference in estimated costs under the two approaches separately for large OATS reporters, small OATS reporters, large non-OATS reporters, and small non-OATS reporters.</p>

      <p>209 Small firm total estimated implementation costs include a compound annual growth rate of 5% to account for increases in labor and operational costs over time. The rate was applied for one year, from the beginning of CAT reporting in year 1 through the expected incurring of build costs by small firms in the year prior to the start of their reporting (i.e., year 2). Because large firms report a year earlier than small firms and would incur most implementation costs in year 1, a similar rate has not been applied to their implementation costs.</p>

      <p>228 There is empirical evidence that firms&#8217; order routing decisions respond to changes in trading fees. Such evidence finds that an increase in the level of an exchange&#8217;s net fee is associated with a decrease in trading volume and market share relative to other exchanges. This evidence suggests that there is sufficient competition among Execution Venues such that where the Participant&#8217;s costs for the CAT are material it may be difficult for Execution Venues to fully pass those costs to broker-dealers. This argument holds as long as broker-dealers are not able to pass such costs on to their customers.
