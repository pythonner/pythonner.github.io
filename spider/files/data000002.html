          <p id="6d2a36a0-577f-4ca8-bd53-9fefd9bbebd4">An Industry Member Identifier, IMID, is any identifier assigned by an SRO to one of its members. Examples of SRO assigned identifiers include FINRA MPIDs, Nasdaq MPIDs, NYSE Mnemonics, CBOE User Acronyms, and CHX Acronyms.</p>
          <p id="1e859085-94fb-468a-ac70-f5cf8c735e80">Reportable events will use fields with the Data Type "IMID" to refer to the Industry Member performing the action described by the event, and/or the entity that is the subject of the action described by the event. In other words, an IMID type field will be used in all scenarios where an Industry Member must refer to themselves or another Industry Member in an event.</p>
          <p id="44f31920-0629-453b-8bad-b4324e4f713d">This IMID approach allows the Industry Member to use any SRO-Assigned Industry Member Identifier in the Reportable Events. Acknowledging the potential that the same SRO-assigned Industry Member Identifier may be used by different SRO for different entities, CAT will publish a daily file to highlight any conflict among the SRO-assigned Industry Member Identifiers. Such conflicts are detected in the processing of the daily member dictionaries submitted by each SRO. If a conflict is identified for a specific IMID, the Industry Member may choose to use either the SRO-Assigned Industry Member Identifier by another SRO that is not conflicted with other IDs, or the full format of the IMID - the combination of source (issuing SRO) and the SRO-Assigned Industry Member Identifier - to guarantee uniqueness of the IMID. For example, if AAAA is conflicted with another SRO-Assigned Market Participant Identifier in the CAT, the alternative can be to either use a different SRO-Assigned Market Participant Identifier assigned by another SRO (e.g., AAAB, pointing to the same Industry Member), or the full format FINRA:AAAA - a combination of ID and the source SRO.</p>

For example, John Doe has two accounts at BDA, a regular trading account (account #124) and an IRA account (account #456). BDA would have two different FDIDs in this case, one for John Doe's regular trading account and a second for John Doe's IRA account.</p>
          <p id="16b3da4c-dffd-4e4c-a2aa-e49569be93ce">The FDID for the trading account an order was received or originated for must be reported on all New Order Events.</p>

For example, if an Industry Member assigns a new account or entity identifier to a client or customer for any reason, such as due to a merger, acquisition or some other corporate action, then a new FDID may be created to identify the new account identifier/entity identifier in use at the Industry Member for the entity</p>

          <p id="e2b5ef77-9732-4e91-b1e9-36274e14c1ae">&#8226; Order Key links together the events of the same order, within an Industry Member, e.g. linking an Order Route event to the Order Accepted event. The Order Key is constructed by date, reporter, symbol (or optionID) and orderID.</p>
          <p id="8b41fa88-8cce-413d-a850-43de1da2a7ab">&#8226; Prior Order Key links together the modified, cancel/replaced or internally routed order to the original order. For example, linking an Order Modified event to the Order Accepted event. Generally, the data elements to construct the Prior Order Key are date, reporter, symbol (or optionID), priorOrderID. However, the field names may vary depending on the order events. Please see each order events sections for more details.</p>
          <p id="b4b1fa8b-7ed0-4da9-a22a-b87a5b6031de">&#8226; Route Linkage Key links the order events by the Industry Member routing an order away and the Industry Member accepting the order. Please see <a href="#5dac9eed-d59f-4f12-baca-a226186929fe">Section 2.5.2</a> below for more detailed descriptions.</p>
          <p id="6260d178-bd26-4687-afc5-7c8a234560d5">&#8226; Trade Key: Each Trade event has a Trade Key (date, reporter, symbol (or optionID), tradeID), and each side of the trade has an Order Key that links to the order on side.</p>
          <p id="939ce678-12d0-4215-ba24-893d8790a3f4">&#8226; Fulfillment Key: date, reporter, symbol (or optionID), fulfillmentID</p>

          <p id="a5999caa-25d9-422b-89f8-ddd08adb33a9">Generally, the date used in the linkage key is the calendar date of the event (the date portion of the eventTimestamp). In the scenario when an order event needs to be linked to a prior event on a different date (e.g., modify a GTC order on a prior day), an additional field priorOrderDate is reported on the event and will be used in linking.</p>

        <p id="f1ada2a8-3fcf-4a77-99b7-bab592fb95b5">The Supplement Event serves as a supplement to the New Order event. This event accommodates reporting in two scenarios:</p>
        <p id="cd5c6fa8-0d0e-4968-a5f0-a082452cc4d2">1) When the number of Name/Value pairs included under the aggregatedOrders field causes the New Order event to exceed the maximum allowed message length. Generally, this includes scenarios where so many orders are being aggregated together in a New Order that the number of Name/Value Pairs included in the field aggregatedOrders causes the message to exceed the allowed length.</p>
        <p id="2714cc32-7a3c-4e4e-875d-edc9fbb45fc5">2) When there is no explicit linkage to disparate orders when a representative order is generated. This supplement event can be used to capture the relationship of representative and disparate orders and submitted to CAT separately as an addition to the original New Order event.</p>
        <p id="95e066bd-9855-4d8f-9676-ff27349d822e">This event can be submitted in the same file as the original New Order event or in a separate file, so long as it is submitted on the same date as the New Order event. One New Order event can have multiple New Order Supplement events. Multiple New Order Supplement events are considered as additions (not replacements or modifications). The aggregatedOrders field in the New Order Supplement event should only contain the additional Name/Value Pairs that have not been captured in the original New Order event (or another Supplement event for the same New Order).</p>

A New Order event represents the beginning of the order lifecycle in CAT, therefore a new customer order is represented with a New Order event - not an Order Accepted event. Similarly, orders received by an Industry Member from its non-broker-dealer affiliates or from a non-reporting foreign broker-dealer should be reported as a New Order event - NOT an Order Accepted event. (Note: At the start of Phases 2a and 2b, there will be some lifecycles beginning at Order Accepted event, as small Industry Members will not be required to report until a later phase).</p>

        <p id="1699bc30-19d4-423e-9e1a-245d4e1e976a">Although multiple reporterIMIDs may be attributed to a single Industry Member, routes between different IMIDs attributed to the same Industry Member are not considered internal routes.</p>
        <p id="ca4c996a-b460-4035-9286-f2561a7e09ac">Note that an Order Internal Route event does not follow the logic of sending / receiving two-sided reporting followed throughout the rest of these Industry M ember Technical Specifications. It is required to be reported from the perspective of the recipient desk. The Order Internal Route merely shows that an order was received by an internal destination and if a new orderID has been assigned to the order as a result of this Order Internal Route.</p>
        <p id="5ffd5f6e-9314-4ca3-907f-90f1cebdb0d6">&#8226; Order Internal Route may also represent the routing of partial quantities of an order internally, and the practice of assigning those slices new orderIDs. In this case, multiple internal routes may occur on the same original orderID reported in an Order Accepted event or New Order event. Similarly, if an order is routed internally and then subsequently multiple slices are routed to yet another destination internally, this event should represent the receiving desk, quantities, and new orderIDs of those routed slices as received by the subsequent internal destination. This approach will allow CAT to track changes in orderID within an Industry Member as an order is passed between internal entities or partial quantities are routed to internal entities as slices of another order.</p>
        <p id="da4b5d74-5939-4169-a333-60bad6591ffc">&#8226; The major difference between Order Internal Route and Child Order events is that Child Order event can only be used when no desk change or desk route happens. For example, some Industry Members may choose to first generate child orders using the Child Order event to represent slices of a parent order, then to route those slices internally to another desk (Order Internal Route event). This approach is also acceptable for CAT reporting and will not result in unlinked events.</p>

        <p id="fc62cec1-6c5b-4548-bf89-463ef4f0a9b2">CAT provides several ways to report parent/child order activity. The Child Order event is provided solely for the convenience of Industry Members to help model scenarios in which an order is split or sliced into smaller "child" orders that are handled independently of their parent order - in a way that best reflects each individual Industry Member&#8217;s system(s).</p>
        <p id="3d7e745d-6bc4-438e-b347-142a1be93f53">For example, in the scenario when Industry Members create independent child orders with new orderIDs, if the Child Order event is reported, then the changes of order IDs are captured. Afterwards, the Industry Member can reference each individual child order in any subsequent event by the new order ID. However, if no Child Order event is reported, then the Industry Member can only reference the order at the parent level by the order ID of the parent. There is no scenario in which the use of Child Order event is mandatory.</p>
        <p id="2ded1549-bcfe-4755-a729-f79f2919b1bc">Notes:</p>
        <p id="03281835-83a6-4d36-939c-abf576db8bff">&#8226; Child Order event can only be used when an order is sliced and assigned new order IDs within the same desk. An Order Internal Route event must be reported when routed to another desk.</p>
        <p id="a0905b5c-8e84-4d51-9e96-4012ce15d253">&#8226; There is no limit to how many "generations" can be created through Child Order events. The parentOrderID will be the orderID of the most recent order, whether that was a New Order/Order Accepted or a previous Child Order.</p>
        <p id="1074e473-e3b4-4b6f-aad8-a93821c273dd">&#8226; Child Orders must belong to the same FDID as the parent orders. Child Orders should not be used to create representative orders. If the FDID changes, a representative New Order event must be used and not a Child Order.</p>
        <p id="8690205b-2811-4e5e-8591-aa5480f7d792">&#8226; Child Orders should not be used for equity legs of a multi-leg option order.</p>

The first is when an Industry Member executes a trade between two desks or departments involving two proprietary accounts of the firm, but because there is no change in beneficial ownership, no trade is reported for public dissemination. In this instance a REC of &#8220;P&#8221; should be used on the Trade Event. The second is when an Industry Member executes a trade and must report the trade via Form T.

Order Fulfillment reports are required for scenarios where a representative order was used to facilitate the execution of the customer/client order. Examples include orders executed on a riskless principal basis and orders executed on an agency basis via a representative agency order, such as in aggregation scenarios. An Order Fulfillment is also required when an order is routed to a foreign market and the resulting foreign execution is not captured by CAT. In this scenario, the Order Fulfillment is used to obtain the execution information for the customer order since such information is not otherwise available in CAT.</p>

To address these expected unlinked events, two fields (priorUnlinked and nextUnlinked) are used as described below. The purpose of these fields is to identify that the immediately preceding or following event is not reportable in Phase 2b and is not present for linkage. An immediately preceding or following event may be a manual event, complex order event, or a paired order. The priorUnlinked and nextUnlinked fields have values to indicate why the immediately preceding or following event is not present.</p>

If an Industry Member cannot do this, the Industry Member must populate the handlingInstructions field with 'CMPX' to indicate that the order (route) is part of a complex option order in Phase 2b. In addition, such voluntarily reported single leg orders must include a priorUnlinked or nextUnlinked flag of 'C', as applicable, to indicate they will not link to a related order at the sending (receiving) firm.</p>

        <p id="f8af2d9c-6d55-4fc5-80e5-98e20e89b8e5">An Option Order Internal Route events must be reported when an order is passed internally to a different department or desk within a reporterIMID.</p>
        <p id="ff4ed77f-d4fe-4470-8a85-8fc5832ac109">Although multiple reporterIMIDs may be attributed to a single Industry Member, routes between different IMIDs attributed to the same Industry Member are not considered internal routes.</p>
        <p id="4ee392c4-37e5-4529-be6d-adacda5015e4">Note that an Optional Order Internal Route event does not follow the logic of sending/receiving two-sided reporting followed throughout the rest of these Industry Member Technical Specifications. It is required to be reported from the perspective of the recipient desk. The Option Order Internal Route merely shows that an order was received by an internal destination and if a new orderID has been assigned to the order as a result of the Option Order Internal Route.</p>
        <p id="480a6aaf-3919-45da-ab9c-978da2982965">&#8226; An Option Order Internal Route may also represent the routing of partial quantities of an option order internally, and the practice of assigning those slices new orderIDs. In this case, multiple slices are routed to yet another destination internally - this event should represent the receiving desk, quantities, and new orderIDs of those routed slices as received by the subsequent internal destination. This approach will allow CAT to track changes in orderID within an Industry Member as an order is passed between internal entities or partial quantities are routed to internal entities as slices of another order.</p>
        <p id="1d272ed9-c18e-4e3b-9a5c-65536a5ecdb7">&#8226; The major difference between Option Order Internal Route and Child Option Order events is that the Child Option Order event can only be used when no desk change or desk route happens. For example, some Industry Members may first choose to generate child orders using the Child Option Order event to represent slices of a parent order, then route those slices internally to another desk (Option Order Internal Route event). This approach is also acceptable for CAT reporting and will not result in unlinked events.</p>
        <p id="11cd917d-0ae9-421e-b560-3462d4425403">Option Order Internal Route Modified and Option Order Internal Route Canceled are not required to be reported until Phase 2d.</p>

        <p id="defecd44-b0db-46fa-803a-780929baabbe">For example, in the scenario when Industry Members create independent child orders with new orderIDs, if the Child Option Order event is reported, then the changes of order IDs are captured.

To achieve this the standard capabilities of PGP will be utilized and will require encrypting, signing, and secure hashing of data. While these steps must be followed, Submitters have a choice of compression algorithms, passphrase selection and length, as well as what tools they use on their platform. When encrypting a metadata file, the CAT public encryption key must be used. This public key will be made available to reporters. The file may also be encrypted with the public key of the submitter and the public key of the reporter. Encrypted files can only be decrypted by the private key corresponding with the public key used to encrypt the file; including the optional public keys of Submitter and Reporter ensures that private key holders of CAT, Reporter, and Submitter can decrypt the encrypted file.</p>

The cipher algorithm must be AES-256(recommended) or higher. When encrypting data files, the submitter may also sign the file with their private key. Metadata files must always be signed in cleartext, and then encrypted. All files must be compressed before, or with the encryption process. The digest algorithm used to sign the file must be SHA256. The signature should also be part of the encrypted file (i.e. no detached signatures). Once a file has been encrypted and/or signed, the extensions .pgp, .gpg, or .asc must be appended to the end of the filename; OpenPGP compliant tools will do this for you.</p>

        <p id="abad96da-a701-404f-a2dc-20c2c53ac3f9">If there are failures or warnings, they will be available in the feedback file.

        <p id="384609ea-e24f-456e-a912-6c70e18a8fe5">If any of the ingestion failures correspond to specific records, a reject file (with extension .reject) will also be generated in the download/failures directory in the home directory of both the submitter and reporter. The reject filename will be included with the feedback record under the field rejectFile. The reject file will be populated with Correction Records containing the original rejected records and record index, to make corrections easier to submit (as described in the Corrections section). The record index is the offset from the beginning of the file to the first byte of the record.</p>
        <p id="b6794bc7-6764-4532-81a1-7909ae72c375">Feedback files will have the same base name as the submitted file. The file name will be appended with an extension describing the feedback type and .pgp. It will be compressed, encrypted, and signed. Compression will be based on the compression preferences associated with the public keys used to encrypt the feedback file. The keys used will be the CAT Reporting Agent's key, Industry Member&#8217;s key (if different), and the CAT public key. It will be signed with the CAT private key. For example, if a file was submitted from CAT Reporter &#8220;MYID&#8221;, with the following name:</p>
        <p id="aea08422-99ff-4069-a434-0957e13d01a1">MYID_20170101_OrderEvents_000123.csv.gz.pgp</p>
        <p id="3bca0779-78d4-4ec6-96da-64e9213016ff">The following would be the filename for the acknowledgement feedback file:</p>
        <p id="4af0291e-eec4-434b-8f7c-48e9d08b690c">MYID_20170101_OrderEvents_000123.ack.pgp</p>
        <p id="9c11a043-beec-43ab-bea2-20c611609b09">Filenames are considered unique using the base name of the file (i.e., after removing all suffixes). Thus, trying to upload files that differ only in extension would be considered an error for uploading files with duplicate filenames.</p>
        
        <p id="b0929ae6-c2f6-41ce-b63a-63c0732c81d7">If multiple files are submitted with the same base name, but with different format or compression extensions, then a _&lt;N&gt; will be applied to the base name of the second and subsequent feedback file names, where N will be the iteration of the feedback file.</p>
        <p id="60cebff6-9dcd-4571-a652-3f73a7d122c6">If multiple files are submitted with the same base name or CAT needs to provide feedback when reprocessing a file feedback, an _&lt;N&gt; will be applied to the base name of the feedback files to avoid overwrite of any feedback files contained at that time in the download directories.</p>
        <p id="05a69ef6-5eed-4352-b0d4-f08bff6d545b">Feedback files will be generated as each data file goes through various stages of processing. CAT will have four main processing stages, as described below:</p>

        <p id="11011ffb-782c-44ec-94c4-aa0277c96ebf">Please see the following sections for details of each stage.</p>
        <p id="f24f8d98-ae8f-4b9b-8ed0-8c94474de6a0">Some stages will complete almost immediately, generating feedback shortly after the file has been uploaded (e.g. File Acknowledgement stage); other stages may take significant time, meaning that feedback could be delayed (either due to queuing behind other jobs, or because certain data elements are required to advance). For file acknowledgement, basic file integrity or ingestion stages, feedback will be provided as soon as the processing of each stage is completed. However, the feedback from linkage discovery phase, due to the dependency on other reporters' order events, will not be provided prior to noon on T+1, when all feedback is required to be returned.</p>
        <p id="9f49de2b-cae4-4f1d-b118-fd40fcbbd4a8">The minimum retention time for feedback files on the sftp server is 10 business days; after that time they may be removed from the server. Feedback will continue to be available after that time via the Reporter Web Portal.</p>

        <p id="f440d3d2-980c-43f7-b55e-6443ea0d1dec">&#8226; If the number of records in the file does not match the Record Count in the metadata file or metadata block, the entire file will be rejected.</p>
        <p id="d247c8df-55f5-4025-9959-f37dd97405c4">&#8226; If an Order Event file contains anything other than expected order event messages, the entire file will be rejected.</p>
        <p id="28ab7501-c5bc-475c-8ed7-eb73e7ec9cfe">Each field of the order event will be checked and validated, resulting in one of three states for the record: success, error, or warning. An error will prevent the record from being processed. A warning will not prevent the record from being processed, but may indicate that a record will be subject to errors during a later stage or processing. Depending on the type of warning, the record may be processed and ignored, or processed and applied to the data set. A record with only warning(s) but without error(s) do not require corrective action from the Industry Member.</p>
        <p id="cd88386c-5f29-4181-8bad-ff45dcb875b2">For example, there are occasions where symbols are &#8220;delisted&#8221; late and may already have been referenced by some Industry Members (most likely in stage two). CAT allows incremental uploads throughout the day. Thus, their order event reports may contain opens and/or cancels for those symbols. Instead of rejecting these records, CAT will generate warnings for benign order actions and silently ignore them. Execution events for such symbols, however, will generate errors.</p>
        <p id="5d9b67a9-aa32-49bd-8e6a-5279cdf52bd5">The system is backward compatible when there is a change or transition to a new version of reporting specifications. In such cases where the latest/preferred method is detectable, but not detrimental, a warning may be generated to inform the reporter on the details, but the record will still be accepted and processed by the system.</p>

      <p id="592f732a-2c13-4621-ab95-44abaf883573">o As the go-live date approaches, Industry Members will be able to conduct testing and will receive support from the Plan Processor to prepare for production reporting using the revised Technical Specifications format. The revised Technical Specifications will include a summary list of changes as well as a table listing the specific areas of the document where the changes have been made.</p>
      <p id="b22ab169-94dd-4b30-89d3-dce88b514510">B. Clock Synchronization Requirement</p>
      <p id="c5f7b7fe-568a-4b7e-b01b-57264b7da471">In previous sections, details are described regarding Order Events and data elements. Timestamp, as one of the required data elements for each order event, must be correctly reported by Industry Members at predefined granularity. This section provides an overview of the corresponding clock synchronization requirements applicable to Industry Members.</p>
      <p id="55ba5dae-f015-4928-bea8-a9ae5bda7e30">In order to comply with applicable requirements of Clock Synchronization and correctly record the Timestamp fields for order events. Industry Members are required to synchronize Business Clocks at a minimum to within 50 milliseconds of the time maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and to maintain such synchronization. Business clocks that are solely used for Manual Order Events or for the time of allocation on Allocation Reports must be synchronized at a minimum to within a one second tolerance.</p>
      <p id="741cca3e-96d5-4599-96ad-15fc12283893">The tolerance includes:</p>
      <p id="7159af53-eb7a-4c3b-a9b5-a2a2ec4385c9">&#8226; The difference between the NIST standard and a time provider&#8217;s clock;</p>
      <p id="1a5a67e6-19bf-45f3-a77c-e92e5e481742">&#8226; Transmission delay from the source; and</p>
      <p id="8c0e3338-94dc-4b73-ab76-349a42bba8d8">&#8226; The amount of drift in the Participant's clock.</p>
      <p id="3d944722-1cd6-4ada-9192-864821f180ac">To ensure the accuracy of timestamps for Reportable Events, Industry Members must document and maintain their synchronization procedures for Business Clocks. Industry Members must keep a log of the time when they synchronize their Business Clocks and the results of the synchronization process. This log should include notice of any time a Business Clock drifts more than the applicable tolerances specified above. Such log must include results for a period of time of not less than five years ending on the then current date, or for the entire period for which the Industry Member has been required to comply with this Rule if less than five years. Industry Members must also certify their compliance with these clock synchronization requirements and report violations according to requirements established by the Operating Committee.</p>
      <p id="688718d4-68f1-4369-bca2-ca8b6fe00b29">Any time provider and technology may be used for clock synchronization as long as the Business Clocks are in compliance with the accuracy requirement.</p>
      <p id="f9447c06-5feb-4fbf-857f-f1d698a1a963">If additional details are needed, please refer to the Clock Sync User Guide to be published, or to Participants' applicable rules.</p>
      <p id="7b992617-ab49-4194-a1c0-f1b69007ccab">Note: The tolerance for clock synchronization does not impact the amount of time allowed for CAT reporting. CAT does NOT require Industry Members to report order information within 50 milliseconds of receiving an order.</p>
      <p id="b0ffec65-5491-413d-bfc1-0fa9ccbaa067">C. Representative Order Linkages</p>
      <p id="16fa3d84-d88f-480a-9e5b-4b1346265752">The CAT NMS Plan requires that customer orders be linked to representative orders created in firm accounts for the purpose of facilitating the execution of a customer order. This Appendix outlines reporting requirements for creating linkages between customer and representative orders.</p>

      <p id="5ee34fb8-b89c-4cf1-aa7d-05bffcb5211c">Linkages are required between the customer/clients order and the representative order for both executed and unexecuted orders. Executed orders must also have a link between the Order Fulfillment Event for the customer/client order and the representative order from which the fill came.</p>
      <p id="146a5fe8-297c-4eb8-9760-4c2e1a5bfc46">The following fields are used in the linkage process:</p>

      <p id="ba720cfe-6c48-49d2-b407-889b58902601">Order IDs must be unique within the same calendar date. In the table above, the orderID in row 1 and 2 are distinct since both orders have a calendar date of 9/12. The Trading Day is not used for determining orderID uniqueness, as illustrated in rows 5 and 6.</p>
      <p id="426361c6-7136-4a9f-9ff0-b86bf92f0b6d">The Trading Day for Industry Members is defined as starting 1 millisecond after 4:15PM on one trade date and ending 4:15PM on the next trade date. As shown in rows 1 and 2, events with a timestamp after 4:15PM (row 2) are considered to be the following trading date and are not due until T+1 at 8:00AM. Alternatively, Industry Members may submit one file one file per calendar day (the orders on rows 1 and 2 can both be submitted on a 9/12 file). The Trading Day only exists to determine the reporting deadline of an event, it does not impact the date used to create linkage or the file name.</p>
      <p id="71117bd8-8a77-49a0-b336-f0d3827cca63">Weekends are excluded from Trading Days. Events from 4:15PM on a Friday to 4:15PM the follow Monday are the same Trading day, but files must be separated by the calendar date (see rows 4, 5, and 6).</p>
      <p id="b2ff865e-3053-4f07-bda0-57e6827e370c">Holidays are also excluded from Trading Days. Hypothetically, if Monday 9/17 were are holiday in the example, the next available Trading Day becomes Tuesday 9/18.</p>

      <p id="db24b76c-3301-4d8a-8acd-f1a1151dc070">&#8226; Value will be an alphanumeric (12) code that represents a specific error or warning. The list of values will be refined and a complete list of codes and descriptions will be provided.</p>
      <p id="c0bb2548-df79-4df2-ad51-39e842fc50e4">A failure code may be used for warnings or errors, distinguished by the severity field in the failure report. The failure code itself does not distinguish between a warning (in which a record is accepted but still shows up in the feedback report) and an error (which causes a record to be rejected).</p>
      <p id="49aa2882-b246-46eb-8bf3-b4a12b865098">A failure description is a human readable field returned with a failure code that informs a user which field failed, the value which was submitted (if applicable to the error), and why it is incorrect. The failure descriptions are specific to the type of field that has a failure and the original value used by the reporter.</p>
      <p id="e9189610-6c52-4397-911f-7c3e9dfc1324">For example, the following failure code tells the user the severity is an error, the failure was identified on an Order Event file during the ingestion stage, and the field originalOrderID is missing from the record.</p>

Further, the events related to Simple Electronic Option Orders subject to reporting in Phase 2b are limited to those events which involve electronic receipt of an order, or electronic routing of an order. Electronic receipt of an order is defined as the initial receipt of an order by an Industry Member in electronic form in standard format directly into an order handling or execution system. Electronic routing of an order is the routing of an order via electronic medium in standard format from one Industry Member&#8217;s order handling or execution system to an exchange or another Industry Member.</p>
