      <p id="6dd065c8-0b37-4313-bbde-0497d8fe67d0">This document is a companion document to the CAT Reporting Technical Specifications for Industry Members (&#8220;Technical Specifications&#8221;) and is provided to assist Industry Members in implementing the reporting requirements laid out in the Technical Specifications. This document illustrates the specific reporting requirements for a variety of order handling execution scenarios for both equities and options Eligible Securities (as defined in the CAT NMS Plan). The scenarios illustrate the reporting requirements for Phases 2a and 2b. Additional scenarios will be added for Phases 2c and 2d when the Technical Specifications are published for those phases.</p>
      <p id="f364bf71-4ed5-4a0a-b893-241136ae78d7">The reporting scenarios are presented in a separated document from the Technical Specifications to provide the greatest flexibility in the ability to modify or add scenarios as new questions are presented and trading practices evolves. It is expected that changes and additions will be necessary for reporting scenarios with greater frequency than changes to the Technical Specifications that would be required when record format, field value changes, etc., occur. By maintaining a separate reporting scenarios document, reporting scenarios may be clarified or added without the need for a new version of the Technical Specifications.</p>
      <p id="29baafbf-3a8a-44de-9d33-7aa72483db08">This document contains interpretive guidance for Industry Member CAT Reporters with respect to how the Technical Specifications must be implemented. As such, any changes to this document are subject to the same review and approval process by the Operating Committee, pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan, as the Technical Specifications.</p>
      <p id="9601b3d8-ddb6-4848-b3de-ee3752aa222e">This document represents a phased approach to industry reporting. Please note that a proposed amendment to the CAT NMS Plan will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") to reflect the phased approach for the Industry member CAT reporting described in the Technical Specifications. The proposed amendment will be subject to the approval of the Commission.</p>

Per CAT FAQ #H1, each time an Industry Member reprices a peg order based on a market move (i.e., when there is a change in the national best bid or offer or the best bid or offer on a particular exchange, as applicable based on the terms of the order), the Industry Member must report a price modification of the peg order to the CAT pursuant to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Recording and Reporting by Participants">Section 6.3(d) of the CAT NMS Plan</a>, as applied to Industry Members by Section 6.4(d)(i) of the CAT NMS Plan, if the price is modified. If the Industry Member does not reprice a peg order when the market moves, the Industry Member does not need to report a modification of the peg order to the CAT since the order was not modified by either the customer or the Industry Member. For example, for both displayed and non-displayed alternative trading systems (ATSs), if an ATS&#8217;s matching engine reprices a peg order when the market moves, the price modification must be reported to the CAT. If a matching engine does not reprice a peg order when the market moves, there is no requirement to report a price modification to the CAT.</p>
