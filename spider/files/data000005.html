            <p id="c16998ac-c2a8-4974-a732-7c2ae39affe4">Debt securities are issued by many different entities, including the U.S. government, counties, cities, corporations, and financial institutions, as well as international bodies and can take the form of a number of different security types. Debt securities can vary based on factors such as issuer characteristics (e.g., federal government versus private corporations) and issue characteristics (e.g., coupon rate, collateral, maturity), and trading practices in different types of debt securities can also vary (e.g., electronic trading versus voice messaging). Such differences can also lead to different clientele for the instruments. For example, while there is a lot of retail participation in the municipal securities market, mainly due to the tax advantage of interest income for some investors, the corporate bond market has a combination of retail and institutional investors, and securitized products are mainly traded by institutions.</p>
            <p id="0534baa7-0ed1-4c98-9fa4-b3585d5df9a4">There are also differences in regulatory reporting across debt securities. FINRA, the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;), and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;)<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-4" NAME="fr_pz8-4">8</a> each already require reporting of certain information for debt securities. The MSRB&#8217;s rules govern the reporting of transactions in municipal securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-5" NAME="fr_pz8-5">9</a> The NYSE&#8217;s rules govern the entry, display and execution of orders and the reporting of transactions in debt securities on the NYSE Bonds&#174; system.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-6" NAME="fr_pz8-6">10</a> FINRA rules govern the reporting of trades in most other types of debt securities. The debt securities currently reportable to FINRA&#8217;s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&#8220;TRACE&#8221;) system include:<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-7" NAME="fr_pz8-7">11</a></p>
            <p id="0d5bd8a5-c6fa-4d2c-b594-6a79a80dcea6">&#8226; Corporate Bonds: Corporate bonds are issued by individual companies to raise money for capital expenditures, operations, and acquisitions. There are many types of corporate bonds with various structures, coupon rates, maturity dates and credit quality, among other characteristics.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-5" NAME="fr_pz9-5">12</a></p>
            <p id="39b0e42c-623d-4f25-bef9-06efb86152f8">&#8226; Asset-Backed Securities (&#8220;ABSs&#8221;): ABSs are certificates that represent an interest in a pool of assets such as credit card receivables, auto loans and leases, home equity loans, and even the future royalties of a musician. This class includes Mortgage-Backed Securities (&#8220;MBSs&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-6" NAME="fr_pz9-6">13</a></p>
            <p id="7b43fe73-8e95-482f-9917-e22ec79d5b2f">&#8226; Agency Debt Securities (&#8220;Agencies&#8221;): There are two types of Agencies: (1) bonds issued or guaranteed by U.S. federal government agencies; and (2) bonds issued by government-sponsored enterprises (&#8220;GSEs&#8221;)&#8212;corporations created by Congress to foster a public purpose, such as affordable housing. Bonds issued or guaranteed by federal agencies such as the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) are backed by the &#8220;full faith and credit of the U.S. government,&#8221; like Treasuries. This is an unconditional commitment to pay interest payments and to return the principal investment in full to the security holder when a debt security reaches maturity. Bonds issued by GSEs such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) are not backed by the same guarantee as federal government agencies.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-7" NAME="fr_pz9-7">14</a></p>

            <p id="040d7694-aa13-47a1-ac36-b8dd549f7d6a">&#8226; Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Backed ABS: An SBA-Backed ABS is a debt instrument issued by a program of the SBA for which the timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the SBA. An SBA-Backed ABS represents an ownership interest in a pool or pools of loans or debentures and structured to &#8220;pass through&#8221; the principal and interest payment made by the borrowers in such loans or debentures to the holders of the security on a pro rata basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-6" NAME="fr_pz10-6">16</a></p>
            <p id="e66c5f8b-6e95-41ce-91d7-075a0a91d76b">In addition to FINRA&#8217;s TRACE reporting requirements, the MSRB requires reports of transactions in municipal securities, which are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other state or local governmental entities to raise money to fund public projects. Most municipal debt pays a specified amount of interest (usually semiannually) and returns the principal to the security holder on a specific maturity date.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-7" NAME="fr_pz10-7">17</a> Because the MSRB is not a Participant in the CAT NMS Plan, it did not participate in preparation of the Expansion Document, and since the MSRB has specific jurisdiction over municipal securities, the Participants recommend that the MSRB be consulted before any analysis regarding the potential expansion of the CAT to municipal securities is undertaken.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-8" NAME="fr_pz10-8">18</a> Thus, although some concepts discussed in the Expansion Document may be relevant to municipal securities, it is generally focused on debt securities that are reportable to TRACE or the NYSE as of the date of the Expansion Document.</p>

            <p id="faf2618d-5b7f-4cf1-b953-d7be0e642f84">The U.S. debt markets and equity markets are vastly different in most material respects. As noted above, the markets vary significantly in types of issuers, issue characteristics, trading, and regulatory regimes such as the level of market transparency on both a pre- and post-trade basis. All of these differences would influence how expanding the CAT to include reporting for debt securities could be efficiently and effectively achieved. Below, we describe some of the key characteristics of the government and corporate debt markets.</p>
            <p id="e67b409e-0df3-46a6-81b7-eb17dc656c05">First, the U.S. debt market is significantly larger than the equities market in terms of both the number of outstanding securities and the amount of capital raised; however, the size of the U.S. debt market is heavily influenced by U.S. Treasury securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-4" NAME="fr_pz11-4">19</a> Second, there are significantly more issuances of debt securities as compared with equity securities. Many public companies may have only one class of stock, but can issue numerous types of bonds with different yields, maturities, and denominations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-5" NAME="fr_pz11-5">20</a> For example General Electric has only one class of stock, but it has issued over 1,000 unique bonds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-6" NAME="fr_pz11-6">21</a> In addition, daily trading volumes are significantly different for equities than for debt, with the number of trades in equity securities far surpassing trades in debt securities.</p>
            <p id="58986593-df11-4b05-8c80-78eb1700e74c">The following charts highlight some of the more significant differences between the debt markets and the equity markets. Chart 1 compares the monthly value of new issue corporate bonds and public corporate stocks in the United States from January 2015 to January 2017.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-7" NAME="fr_pz11-7">22</a></p>
            <p id="4729899c-ecc9-4b7e-b30f-51b53a02d629">Chart 2 demonstrates the number of issues in the U.S. debt and equities markets by charting the number of unique CUSIPs reportable to a FINRA facility as of the beginning of the calendar year for each of the last five years.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-3" NAME="fr_pz13-3">23</a> As the chart makes clear, there are significantly more CUSIPs for debt securities than for equity securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-4" NAME="fr_pz13-4">24</a></p>
            <p id="663b493f-b830-4fb2-99ad-21089a5c4794">Chart 3 displays the average daily trading volume for U.S. corporate debt, all TRACE reported debt, and exchange-listed equity securities for each month from January 2016 to March 2017.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz14-2" NAME="fr_pz14-2">25</a> As the chart makes clear, in any given month the trading volume on equities exchanges is generally over five times that in U.S. corporate debt. However, when compared with all TRACE reported debt, the notional volume of transactions in U.S. debt and exchange-listed equity securities is relatively similar due to the high notional volume of transactions in Agency MBSs.</p>
            <p id="17e02534-1f27-4173-a55e-2741296ca4f8">Chart 4 shows the combined equity trades on exchanges compared to the TRACE reported trades during each quarter of 2016.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-4" NAME="fr_pz16-4">26</a> Despite the fact that there are substantially more bonds in the market and more new bond issuances, the volume of equity trades is higher, and there are significantly more equity transactions on a daily basis than bond transactions. While exchanges had in excess of 1.5 billion trades each quarter, with one quarter over 2.5 billion, TRACE averages only 4.5 million reported trades per quarter.</p>
            <p id="0b7be017-902e-47e7-afad-55545b7f0979">Another major difference between the bond and equity markets is the size of the trades. The dollar value of bond transactions typically is greater than stock transactions. The average size of a bond trade exceeds $500,000 whereas the average stock trade is less than $10,000.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-5" NAME="fr_pz16-5">27</a> These large transaction sizes are the result of a substantial portion of transactions by institutional investors in the debt markets as compared to the equity markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-6" NAME="fr_pz17-6">28</a> Chart 5 uses Federal Reserve financial sector data to chart retail investors in different bond types.</p>
            <p id="0ed3533f-91f1-43eb-8039-05d1af93729a">Chart 5: Presence of Retail Investors in the Bond Market<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-7" NAME="fr_pz17-7">29</a></p>
            <p id="23c79777-47c0-41be-8fcf-eabfb76c591f">In general, the debt markets have a much higher proportion of institutional market participants than in the equity markets, in which retail investor participation is substantially higher.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-8" NAME="fr_pz17-8">30</a> However, for purposes of Chart 5, institutional investors include mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and endowments. When these forms of indirect ownership are factored in, 49% of U.S. households are invested in bonds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-9" NAME="fr_pz17-9">31</a></p>
            <p id="a31c1c77-5213-42ad-a02e-dae383dc41bd">Two other major differences between the debt and equity markets are related. Due to the vast number and variety of debt securities outstanding, most individual debt securities trade much less often than a typical stock, particularly listed stocks. For an equity security that is listed on an exchange, there is an active market for the stock, and, consequently, it is easy to obtain a current price for any particular listed stock. However, bonds and other debt securities tend to actively trade during the period after their initial issue, but, thereafter, trading in a particular debt security may not occur for months or even years.</p>
            <p id="e085e97d-b8d3-4ce6-bfdb-c10003ff66bc">Chart 6: Trading Volume Reduction in Corporate Debt 90 Days After Issuance<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-5" NAME="fr_pz18-5">32</a></p>
            <p id="d0ab93e4-392d-4e8e-9975-c1836c58b885">Because of the relative lack of liquidity in the debt markets compared to the equity markets, there is significantly less pre-trade price transparency for most debt securities compared to equity securities. In addition, because of the relative lack of trading activity in the debt markets compared to the equity markets, it is significantly less difficult to link specific orders in debt securities to resultant trades. For example, an order in an equity security may be split into numerous child orders (or numerous orders can be aggregated into a larger order). By requiring that the parent order and each child order be linked, the equity order audit trail provides insight into these relationships that otherwise would be difficult to ascertain.</p>
            <p id="cde7d3ff-3f5b-48dc-ab37-917f091920dd">Along with these fundamental differences in the character of equity versus debt securities, the manner in which orders are handled in the two markets&#8212;and even what constitutes an &#8220;order&#8221;&#8212;and how trades are executed, differ substantially. In the debt market, it is common for an investor to contact his or her broker to purchase a bond with certain characteristics (e.g., a specific yield, credit rating or maturity) rather than a particular security, and the broker will reach out to other bond brokers and assess what debt securities that meet those criteria are available. Based on this information, the broker generally provides the investor with options, and the investor can choose a particular debt security to purchase when presented with the options. FINRA requires its members to submit trade reports to TRACE and disseminates some of this information; however, this information is limited to post-trade transparency and is subject to other limitations, such as volume thresholds. By contrast, exchanged-listed stocks always have pre-trade bid and offer prices available, often on multiple trading centers.</p>
            <p id="5c601394-e00a-432b-9432-6b304269a38c">Finally, unlike most equity securities, most debt securities are traded over-the counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) rather than on an exchange. In 2017, approximately 10,000 of the approximately 61,500 corporate bonds outstanding&#8211;approximately 16% were reportable to NYSE&#8217;s bond trading platform, which is the largest centralized corporate bond exchange in the U.S..<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz19-4" NAME="fr_pz19-4">33</a> The vast majority of transactions in debt securities are executed through informal networks of bond dealers in the OTC market. Further, while there has been significant growth in electronic trading venues for bonds in recent years&#8212;the number of corporate bond transactions occurring on ATSs has grown to approximately 20%&#8212;much of the activity in this space occurs as a Request for Quote (&#8220;RFQ&#8221;) or similar format where the terms of a trade are negotiated bilaterally.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-8" NAME="fr_pz20-8">34</a></p>

Inter-Dealer Regulatory-Only (IDRO) transactions, which involve instances when an introducing broker effects a trade for a customer against the principal position of its clearing broker, are also reportable to RTRS. For inter-dealer transactions, firms must compare and match their trades through National Securities Clearing Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;NSCC&#8221;) Real-Time Trade Matching (&#8220;RTTM&#8221;) system. RTTM allows firms to satisfy their transaction reporting obligations in addition to matching their inter-dealer transactions. Firms are able to submit their municipal securities transactions for both trade matching and regulatory reporting in a single trade message to RTTM. In an IDRO transaction, the transaction between the clearing and introducing broker is not required to be submitted for comparison purposes in RTTM, because it does not result in a movement of a principal position between dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz28-24" NAME="fr_pz28-24">46</a></p>

          <p id="aef25e3b-f30f-4037-8126-bd2b0ceb6b62">As noted above, unlike for equity securities, there is no current regulatory requirement for broker-dealers to report order information for orders involving debt securities. Consequently, there is no current order reporting framework on which to base potential CAT reporting. Set forth below are three general frameworks that could be used in considering how the CAT might be expanded to include debt securities, though the Participants do not currently recommend that the CAT be expanded to debt securities. The Participants believe that the CAT should first be fully implemented for equities and listed options, and that the Participants should then have the benefit of having gained experience with CAT operation in the equity space prior to analyzing the potential expansion to debt securities. In addition, the Participants believe that industry outreach and input would be necessary to inform any analysis of the potential expansion of the CAT to debt securities.</p>
          <p id="40f33895-3067-4b77-adcb-6fe87569c96b">The possible approaches discussed below by no means are exclusive representations of all frameworks that may warrant discussion. In addition, because current practices related to order taking, sourcing, and agreeing to trades are markedly different for debt securities than for equity securities, the Participants believe that the development of any concept or proposal for CAT expansion (or establishing an order audit trail regime more generally) to debt securities should be carefully considered, including to identify how regulatory objectives may be best met taking these unique characteristics into consideration.</p>
          <p id="c95682bc-464b-4733-bca7-52a03222d640">The three approaches to a possible audit trail framework for debt securities discussed below are presented in order of the simplest and least-granular&#8212;from requiring order-originating firms to report new orders and cancellations/executions (Approach #1), to the most complex and granular, which mirrors more closely the extensive order life cycle-reporting regime for equities and options being implemented for the CAT (Approach #3). The approaches attempt to account for unique order handling processes and features in the market for, or nature of, debt securities. For example, in the market for debt securities, customers may contact their representatives providing only general characteristics regarding the type of debt security they wish to invest in, rather than a particular CUSIP. In these cases, based on the investor&#8217;s criteria, a representative may present to the customer several similar debt securities for consideration prior to the customer deciding on, and placing an order for, a particular security. In addition to oral interactions with customers, orders or indications of interest between dealers also may be communicated manually (e.g., a telephone call or message to a broker&#8217;s broker).</p>
          <p id="dc6dc65e-5d52-45ca-ab71-37db401ee6dc">Some debt securities may not be widely quoted and may trade infrequently and, as a result, information on the security&#8217;s availability and pricing may be limited or unavailable. Firms have stated that representatives, therefore, often must take the additional step of confirming the final details of a potential transaction with the customer prior to executing the order and, for this reason, in these cases the time of order receipt and time of order execution are essentially simultaneous (because the customer officially places the order only once the specifics of the potential transaction are known). Similarly, quotations on electronic platforms (including ATSs) that trade debt securities may not be firm (e.g., RFQs and IOIs). In such cases, the systems do not automatically execute transactions and, instead, require manual confirmation from subscribers. Special consideration would need to be given to the use of non-firm quotation types in debt securities (e.g., RFQs and IOIs) on electronic systems and how this might impact an order audit trail for debt securities.</p>
          <p id="356b8041-b1fb-4100-a275-311721d88f95">Thus, the concept of order receipt, order routing, and assessing the market for some debt securities can be very different than for equities or for listed options. Further, firms have represented that, due to the manual nature of order taking in the debt market, creating a new order record electronically and systematically tracking orders through to execution may be a significant departure from current practice for many firms. In addition, industry participants have represented that the lack of full detail on and experience in reporting to the CAT makes it impossible to evaluate or estimate the direct and indirect costs of CAT expansion to debt securities at this time. As such, the Participants do not believe that applying the current CAT framework to debt securities, without significant modification, would be workable. For these reasons and others, as discussed in Section I.D. below,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-4" NAME="fr_pz39-4">56</a> the Participants do not recommend expanding the CAT to include debt securities at this time.</p>

While this approach describes this activity as a &#8220;route,&#8221; the Participants acknowledge that, because of the differences in the debt markets, typically, the order itself is not truly being routed in the same sense as occurs in the equity markets; rather, the firm is contacting a dealer or market center for indications of interest in the particular bond.</p>

            <p id="efd1e2ff-0072-4ea4-8221-d864fd5ec9a3">In the course of considering how the CAT might be expanded to include debt securities, the Participants also have considered whether the submission of a new order report is the earliest life cycle event that might be captured for debt securities. As noted above, one of the unique features of the debt market is the often simultaneous timing of an order and its execution (where the customer does not place an order until all the specifics of the potential transaction are known). Prior to the entry of an order for a particular security, however, customers may provide firms with desired criteria for a debt security and the firm then works on identifying, locating, and presenting specific options for the customer&#8217;s consideration.</p>
            <p id="c940eb33-6118-45a2-849a-1ac8f9d80c5b">The Participants understand that this process is common in the debt area and, therefore, initially considered whether an audit trail might begin with recording and reporting certain pre-order information obtained by the firm in advance of the entry of an order for a particular security. For example, an approach might be considered where, if a customer provides a minimum number of descriptive elements regarding a debt security &#8212; e.g., where a customer provides several of the following: investment dollar amount; issuer; sector; yield; coupon; maturity; rating; or specified additional features &#8212; a firm conceivably might be required to submit a pre-order report. Any securities presented by the firm to the customer as satisfying the customer&#8217;s criteria also could be entered into a pre-order report and, should an order result, the pre-order report could be linked to the new order report (which would be followed by route, execution or cancellation reports, as applicable). This type of framework would be an attempt to capture in an automated fashion the pre-order events that are likely to be extensive in the debt markets. However, the Participants haven&#8217;t included the concept of a pre-order report in Approach #3 due to the possibly numerous manual steps likely necessary to submit and amend such a report to account for each debt security being explored.</p>
            <p id="49f0804d-ed80-48eb-bf9b-64c5b627944d">Under Approach #3, firms (both originating firms and route recipients) would report the receipt of a new order, though only originating firms would be required to report a customer identifier that would be linkable to a separate database containing the relevant PII. As noted above, although typically the order itself is not being truly routed to multiple firms (the originating firm is contacting a dealer or market center for indications of interest in the particular bond), this approach would require new order reports from all receiving firms and any associated executions or cancellations. Where a firm sends an order to another firm, a route report would be added to the audit trail by the sender (linked to the related new order report). If an order is fully or partially executed, any firm with a new order report related to the execution would enter an execution report that is linked to its new order report in the audit trail. The execution report also would include an identifier that would link it to the related transaction report. Likewise, if the order was cancelled in whole or in part, any firm with a new order report related to the cancellation also would report the cancellation.</p>

One important factor is that there are fewer regulatory entities that would be primary users of order data for debt securities (SEC, MSRB and FINRA) than the universe of regulators for NMS securities, which also would include all national securities exchanges. Thus, the Participants believe that methods other than integrating order audit trail information on debt securities into the CAT should be considered, both from a short-term and long-term solution perspective. For example, the SEC could ask FINRA to: consider ways to enhance its TRACE reporting requirements to include more granular customer information on TRACE-Eligible Securities, such as a large trader identifier or customer categories; and establish a separate reporting mechanism for reporting order-related information that can be linked to TRACE trade reports.</p>

          <p id="12c897f7-5bfa-408c-8847-b0a26e467941">The debt market consists of multiple segmented markets, each with its own clientele and unique trading and reporting practices and processes. Currently, transactions in debt securities in all of the segments except municipal bonds, debt securities issued by a foreign sovereign, and money market instruments are, or soon will be, reportable to TRACE. However, the economic impacts on firms of expanding the CAT to debt securities likely differ in significant ways across these segments due to the differences in the nature and amount of data that is collected in the pre-trade and trade processes in each segment. Such differences in data collection are attributable, to a large extent, to different trading mechanisms (e.g., telephonic communications versus electronic trading systems) and varying levels of automation that are implemented in the trading process (e.g., algorithmic trading).</p>
          <p id="1222f085-0ba1-456c-86e7-61c912bfeaa8">Trading in most debt securities traditionally occurred OTC via messaging across broker-dealers and large institutions. However, recent advancements in technology, a changing regulatory environment, and market forces are increasing the role of electronic trading in debt securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-3" NAME="fr_pz49-3">58</a> First, the emergence of ATSs and other electronic trading platforms has provided trading opportunities that do not exist in traditional voice trading. Second, regulatory reform initiatives enacted after the financial crisis have decreased dealers&#8217; incentives to hold inventories and reduced proprietary trading by broker dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-4" NAME="fr_pz49-4">59</a> Also, as the SIFMA Report suggests, there has been an increased emphasis on best execution in the debt markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-5" NAME="fr_pz49-5">60</a> This emphasis has increased the value of pre-trade transparency that may provide valuable information on prevailing market values, as well as the sources and movements of liquidity. Third, as the FINRA Study shows, changes in the supply and demand for primary and secondary market transactions for corporate debt have manifested in greater transaction volume, but smaller average transaction sizes and increased numbers of counterparties among dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-6" NAME="fr_pz49-6">61</a></p>
          <p id="44bd529c-5e67-403c-891e-ef53262ae03b">The prevalence of electronic trading in some debt markets is relevant to the discussion of a potential order audit trail for debt securities, as electronic trading protocols may already be systematically collecting some of the information that would be requested in the order life-cycle approaches described above. Accordingly, costs associated with CAT reporting may differ for different debt securities based on the level of electronic trading. The SIFMA Report shows that the number of electronic trading platforms has increased from two in 2000, to an estimated 20 in 2016. There are significant differences across platforms with respect to the bond types being traded, the trading protocols employed, and order types. The BIS Report discusses that the use of electronic trading is greater in the most liquid instruments. According to the SIFMA Report, the share of electronic trading of investment grade bonds is estimated to have increased from approximately 8% in 2013 to 20% in 2015 at the time of the study, whereas the shift to electronic trading is relatively slower in municipal bonds.</p>
          <p id="e6d5bd07-bb98-4b51-a109-4e5f17dfaaea">The BIS Report also draws attention to regulators&#8217; lack of access to comprehensive data generated by trading protocols across electronic trading platforms and the lack of comparability across trade information collected in different types of bonds, consistent with the assertion in the SIFMA Report that &#8220;stakeholders have limited information to gain a robust understanding of the incumbent and new platforms&#8217; functionality and the evolving price discovery and execution protocols.&#8221; These differences can include very basic information, such as whether a bond price is represented as a dollar value, as a yield, or as a basis above a reference security. The fact that the degree of electronic trading varies significantly across different types of debt securities is a relevant factor in considering the challenges that likely would be involved in transitioning from reporting only transaction information to CAT reporting.</p>
          <p id="e4b02829-d2c3-495d-a839-b37401ec3464">The Participants have identified three approaches described in Section I.C. as possible audit trail framework alternatives for debt securities. These approaches differ from each other in terms of the granularity of the data items that would need to be collected, what events in the order life cycle would be captured, the firms that would have reporting obligations, and the linkages that need to be built across the reports.</p>
          <p id="9b648d9b-047b-4d82-9b19-80febfbd5eec">As noted in Section I.B, TRACE reporting requirements apply only to transactions, with no pre-trade or route information collected. Each approach described in Section I.C. above progressively introduces additional layers of data collection and reporting in the pre-trade period, and hence is associated with different levels of costs and benefits.</p>
          <p id="6e1a383f-bf87-4b9d-8059-08c689746336">Approach #1 requires only order originating firms to report and link new orders, cancellations and executions. This approach still requires the creation of a New Order Report that contains information that is not currently reported to regulators. The information that would be contained in an Execution Report is included today in trade reports to the applicable regulator, so the costs of this approach would mostly arise from generating the New Order Report and Cancel Report, and from creating the linkages across reports and to the database that contains the personally identifiable information (PII). Approach #1 would be relatively less costly to implement and provide additional information to regulators than currently is available. For example, if an electronic audit trail were established for debt securities, regulators would have a more efficient means to observe the time of order receipt, the time from receiving the order to execution, and the extent to which others sought to sell the same security at the same time. But this approach provides the regulators with only a limited picture of an order&#8217;s life cycle relative to Approaches #2 and #3, discussed below. Specifically, Approach #1 does not capture the route information that provides a detailed view of the dealers that the order has been exposed to before execution or cancellation.</p>
          <p id="1df1a84f-1957-4d84-b38e-8171602d467d">Approach #2 introduces a Route Report that is linked to the New Order Report, to capture the information on the specific dealers that a bond order travels to before it gets executed or cancelled. As noted in the discussion in Section I.C.1 and 2 above, the Participants acknowledge that orders are not &#8220;routed&#8221; in the debt market as typically occurs in the equity market. However, for purposes of this discussion, a route occurs when a firm sends an order to another firm or solicits interest from or through another firm regarding an order. New Order and Route Reports could enable regulators to have access to a record of the identity, order and timing of dealers contacted as part of a potential purchase or sale of a specific debt security. As with Approach #1, the obligation accrues only once an order for a specific CUSIP or issue has been received. This approach requires the collection of additional information on the life cycle of orders than described in Approach #1, and therefore would be relatively more costly to capture and report. Nevertheless, the route information could provide useful insight regarding routing practices that might potentially be abusive to customers or inconsistent with best execution obligations.</p>
          <p id="3a98f768-1f4a-46f0-b652-4184ccc27dab">Approach #3 requires firms to build a more complete order life-cycle record. This approach resembles the level of granularity required in audit trail reporting for equity securities and potentially provides regulators with the most complete data to conduct markup reviews and surveillance for best execution obligations in debt markets, and enables regulators to compare execution quality across all brokers that orders have been exposed to. Nonetheless, Approach #3 would be the most expensive to implement, as it would require connectivity across firms and collection and reporting of more data. This approach may potentially deter some dealers from accepting orders from other firms because accepting an order from another firm would result in an obligation to create a New Order Report (in addition to Execution and Cancel Reports, as applicable).</p>
          <p id="602b0022-0a5b-4df2-b1bc-71250d5dd8f2">Reporting of primary market transactions may entail further challenges in CAT reporting, as establishing the linkages between New Order and Execution Reports may require more resources for distributions in the primary market, as order receipt and executions are different in nature.</p>
          <p id="4b27a89c-5629-486b-82b0-0b1efd5e3ccd">Since there is no current regulatory requirement for broker-dealers to report order information in debt securities and CAT implementation for equities and options has not yet begun, there currently is no framework to base potential costs regarding the expansion of the CAT to incorporate debt securities. Therefore, the Participants solicited industry feedback regarding the viability of expansion along with the potential direct and indirect costs (challenges) to expansion. The Participants solicited feedback from several market participants as well as industry groups<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz53-9" NAME="fr_pz53-9">62</a> to collect information on the potential economic impacts of such potential expansion on the industry, third-party providers and customers.</p>
          <p id="82d1ffc2-578f-4769-8323-0cfa5d400b71">The Participants actively sought responses to two sets of questions that were shared with the respondents in advance of the meetings. One set solicited feedback regarding the economic impacts associated with data collection, i.e., the new data fields that would have to be collected for each of the potential reporting scenarios described above. Specifically, the questions sought to address issues such as:</p>
          <p id="f0e36e08-e260-489d-b754-704d9f05ade8">&#8226; Whether existing Order Management Systems (OMS) and Execution Management Systems (EMS) for trading in debt securities are flexible enough to accommodate new asset classes and have the capability to capture order life cycles, i.e., linking new orders, routes, cancellations and executions as described in the options above;</p>
          <p id="d3693919-95d7-4828-9e02-8e5724e05986">&#8226; The challenges and costs associated with collecting the information required in the reports and creating new data fields contained in such reports (e.g., Route ID);</p>
          <p id="6fcd1de9-5956-41ae-930e-8f9fe3a1fb3e">&#8226; Whether there are limitations to communication / coordination / standardization across trading desks that would hinder the collection of certain items in the reports; and</p>
          <p id="059ac045-3ea8-4739-b613-f10fae51cceb">&#8226; Characteristics of orders (e.g., orders with special handling instructions) or any order types (such as limit versus market orders, IOC, etc.) for which CAT reporting would potentially require more resources.</p>
          <p id="bc6a1580-39ed-4dc6-b6f8-d3bd345e28dc">The second set of questions was intended to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts associated with reporting information under each of the potential scenarios. The Participants requested feedback on potential issues such as:</p>
          <p id="280b436d-2d34-4d54-86c1-853d40dcfc18">&#8226; The nature of the changes that would be necessary to apply CAT reporting obligations to debt securities (e.g., software, hardware, backup, or connectivity);</p>
          <p id="4ae5ee88-5e4f-4632-9eb5-e5a1e1532759">&#8226; The impact of CAT reporting on order, trade and execution workflows, and competition for provision of intermediation services in debt securities;</p>
          <p id="538058e6-2da9-47c1-87c9-8652c74e1242">&#8226; Whether there would be new functionalities (integration across systems, maintaining and establishing connectivity across brokers, automation of reporting, etc.) and new data management tools (capacity, encryption, transfer, etc.) that would be required to be implemented within the front, middle and back offices;</p>
          <p id="21c48196-91e4-445e-8d85-ebd68c67dc24">&#8226; Whether there would be any cost savings provided by potential convergence of platforms and systems across asset classes; and</p>
          <p id="c5397ed2-9ac3-488e-9c04-b490e6ee5811">&#8226; Whether potential costs vary based on size / business model / characteristics of reporting firms, e.g., introducing vs. clearing firms, large vs. small firms, broker-dealers vs. ATSs.</p>
          <p id="5db6bc8e-d1b7-4ce9-83c5-6c82f3eaa23f">The respondents stated that there were material differences between equity markets and debt markets with respect to order characteristics, order handling and trade execution. The respondents also expressed that order handling and trading is predominantly OTC, where dealers communicate through informal networks.</p>
          <p id="ac8141f9-9e98-4f12-96c7-a0640570c1dc">There may be potential benefits associated with a life cycle reporting regime in debt markets, where more granular data, as depicted in Approach #3, may potentially provide regulators with a detailed view of market participants&#8217; decision-making behavior and can provide further insight into relevant regulatory issues such as the cost of liquidity provision or best execution practices in debt markets. As noted above, order receipt and execution are frequently concurrent, as the execution is an outcome of a negotiated process of order details, and an order is placed only once the execution terms are agreed upon. Moreover, the Participants understand that OMSs that automatically capture the details of the order are not utilized at every firm or for every order; therefore, it is likely that the requirement to collect more information that is not currently being collected will impose greater direct costs on firms, which may potentially result in a change in the way they participate in debt markets, and this could eventually impact investors. Respondents voiced concerns that the collection of order details may become so costly that representatives may switch to offering substitute products such as mutual funds and ETFs to their clients. Such a change in behavior potentially could reduce liquidity in the debt markets, reducing the price efficiency in these instruments. The burden of collecting and reporting such data potentially would be more significant for small firms, and the respondents asserted that some of these firms would be more likely to exit the market.</p>
          <p id="3fc22154-1cd6-4ecf-bf4c-40defb848d91">The respondents also raised concerns regarding establishing linkages across new order, route and execution reports. Building such linkages necessitates creating connectivity across desks and third-party providers, but, due to the manual process of order receipt and routing orders, using a unique order ID to link the reports would not be feasible for most orders. Such a challenge would be more prominent for certain types of securities. Respondents also indicated that communicating with other broker-dealers regarding an order involves multiple feeds and messages and such messages may contain information regarding multiple orders with varying special conditions. Therefore, building a complete order life cycle for debt securities in a manner similar to equities was not perceived by respondents as a viable option.</p>
          <p id="b8d24401-4d6a-4ca2-ab27-77e5ffa1d0e0">Respondents commented that order and execution characteristics are generally different for larger-sized orders, where there is more negotiation and communication across brokers, which may potentially result in a large number of route reports that are recorded manually. Collecting and processing such information may result in significant costs that may hinder the ability to trade large amounts in debt markets.</p>
          <p id="565552e5-6b5a-4d4b-b8df-7dfb65225d78">Respondents also provided feedback on issues pertaining to reporting such information to CAT. They stated that uniform reporting across all debt securities may potentially create gaps and inconsistencies across different types of debt securities due to the differences in characteristics. However, some respondents believed that a single transaction reporting platform for all types of debt securities may save costs in the long run, provided that a single platform is flexible enough to capture differences across life cycles of different security types (i.e., a single platform for reporting TRACE-Eligible and municipal securities, instead of separately reporting to FINRA, NYSE and MSRB).</p>

          <p id="daa44ed3-a8e9-4765-9b04-ce97758ef253">As of the submission of this Expansion Document to the Commission, no Participants or industry members are reporting information to the CAT, and Technical Specifications detailing required order information for equity securities by broker-dealers are not yet available. Consequently, it is impractical for the Participants to attempt to itemize with any degree of specificity, beyond that described in Section I.C. above, the order details that might be appropriate to report information regarding orders in debt securities. Based on conversations with industry participants and industry trade organizations, the Participants note the following important considerations:</p>
          <p id="1ac466c3-6e2e-476a-abe8-a2347f763765">&#8226; Trade information involving significant portions of the debt markets are already reported to FINRA&#8217;s TRACE system, MSRB&#8217;s RTRS system, or to the NYSE Bonds system. Consequently, leveraging existing systems could be a more efficient and cost-effective manner to expand the reporting of information concerning debt transactions to include order information.</p>
          <p id="c6800941-ea66-49ab-bb21-d35316e27c1d">&#8226; Among industry members, order handling practices for debt securities vary significantly from those in place for equity security orders, primarily due to the differences in the nature of the markets between the two types of securities. Consequently, attempting to replicate the order reporting paradigm for equity securities onto the debt markets is not advisable.</p>
          <p id="a66265a3-e1ff-424e-b27a-62f9cbdfda40">&#8226; The obligation to report information concerning debt security orders and transactions to the CAT would fall primarily on broker-dealers as a substantial majority of all debt market activity is conducted OTC rather than on an exchange. Some of these broker-dealers lack the current infrastructure to report order information. For example, 13% of FINRA members that currently report to TRACE do not conduct equity activity and thus do not report to FINRA&#8217;s Order Audit Trail System (&#8220;OATS&#8221;) and would not have CAT reporting requirements under the Plan. Consequently, expanding order reporting obligations to include debt securities would be a costly and time-intensive effort for these firms.</p>
          <p id="01b74383-214a-469c-9c93-3f21f0e9acd7">As a result of these considerations, the Participants do not currently recommend that the Commission take any steps with respect to requiring the reporting of order information regarding debt securities, including primary market transactions in debt securities,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz57-5" NAME="fr_pz57-5">63</a> to the CAT. The Participants believe such an expansion would be premature at this time and should be considered only after both Participants and industry members are successfully reporting equity securities and listed options information to the CAT so that experience with the operation of the CAT can be used to inform any future expansion. In addition, other alternatives, besides an expansion of CAT, should be considered as a means to collect order data related debt securities. As noted previously, the Participants recommend that the MSRB be consulted before any analysis regarding the potential expansion of the CAT to municipal securities is undertaken. Moreover, a reliable cost/benefit analysis cannot be performed until the Participants and industry members have more details as to the specific information that would be required to be reported and how that information would be reported.</p>

During this phase, the underwriter engages in efforts to ascertain indications of interest in purchasing quantities of the underwritten securities at varying prices from potential investors. Based on this information, the underwriter will then decide how to allocate IPO shares to purchasers. Accordingly, the top-account allocation could be defined to include the following: (1) the conditional indications of interest that may fluctuate until the offering syndicate terminates, and (2) the final allocation (that is, the actual allocation of securities to the customers&#8217; accounts).</p>

The SEC also noted that it is unclear whether the cost estimates cover the inclusion of indications of interest, or the final top-account allocation information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz64-8" NAME="fr_pz64-8">80</a></p>
            <p id="e5a56cfa-b135-4324-9b7e-548848c5053d">In light of the varying cost estimates for the inclusion of top-account allocation information in the CAT, the Participants recommend that additional cost analysis be conducted regarding the inclusion of top-account information in the CAT, both for the inclusion of final top-account allocation information and the inclusion of book building indications of interest. Such analysis should be conducted after a period of experience of industry reporting into the CAT. Without the experience of industry reporting into the CAT and without detailed technical analysis by the various industry members who would provide such top-account data, however, the SROs have no ability to improve upon the current cost estimates in this area.</p>

      <p>94 The term &#8220;OTC Equity Security&#8221; is defined in the CAT NMS Plan as &#8220;any equity security, other than an NMS Security, subject to prompt last sale reporting rules of a registered national securities association and reported to one of such association&#8217;s equity trade reporting facilities.&#8221; This would include all equity securities that are not NMS securities other than Restricted Equity Securities, which are not subject to prompt last sale reporting under FINRA rules, see <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;record_id=14046">FINRA Rules 6622(a)(3)</a>, <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4409">6420(f)</a>, and not reportable to FINRA&#8217;s Order Audit Trail System, see <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4431">FINRA Rule 7410(l)</a>.
