    <p id="42999acd-c850-40fa-a908-1faf6eab7fcf">SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;Commission&#8221;) is proposing new <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> under <a href="">Section 11A(a)(3)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;Exchange Act</a>&#8221;) that would require national securities exchanges and national securities associations (&#8220;self-regulatory organizations&#8221; or &#8220;SROs&#8221;) to act jointly in developing a national market system (&#8220;NMS&#8221;) plan to develop, implement, and maintain a consolidated order tracking system, or consolidated audit trail, with respect to the trading of NMS securities.</p>
    <p id="56386580-e55b-4b30-8a76-7d45c2f6b641">The Commission preliminarily believes that with today&#8217;s electronic, interconnected markets, there is a heightened need for regulators to have efficient access to a more robust and effective cross-market order and execution tracking system. Currently, many of the national securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) have audit trail rules and systems to track information relating to orders received and executed, or otherwise handled, in their respective markets. While the information gathered from these audit trail systems aids the SRO and Commission staff in their regulatory responsibility to surveil for compliance with SRO rules and the federal securities laws and regulations, the Commission preliminarily believes that existing audit trails are limited in their scope and effectiveness in varying ways. In addition, while the SRO and Commission staff also currently receive information about orders or trades through the electronic bluesheet (&#8220;EBS&#8221;) system, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> under the Exchange Act,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-13" NAME="fr_pz2-13">1</a> or from equity cleared reports, the information is limited, to varying degrees, in detail and scope.</p>
    <p id="8cfb662d-953e-43c6-8177-e1b9c2e82b68">A consolidated audit trail would significantly aid in SRO efforts to detect and deter fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in the marketplace, and generally to regulate their markets and members. In addition, such an audit trail would benefit the Commission in its market analysis efforts, such as investigating and preparing market reconstructions and understanding causes of unusual market activity. Further, timely pursuit of potential violations can be important in seeking to freeze and recover any profits received from illegal activity.</p>

        <p id="d47abc95-94f3-4b25-b141-9c278c638ae8">The U.S. securities markets have undergone a significant transformation over the last few decades, and particularly in the last few years. Regulatory changes and technological advances have contributed to a tremendous growth in trading volume and the further distribution of order flow across multiple trading centers. Today&#8217;s markets are widely dispersed, with securities often trading on multiple markets, including over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;). Additionally, products that are closely related in nature and objective are also traded on different markets. For example, various markets trade either options on the S&amp;P 500 index,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-5" NAME="fr_pz4-5">2</a> futures on the S&amp;P 500 index,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-6" NAME="fr_pz4-6">3</a> exchange traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;) based on the S&amp;P 500 index,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-7" NAME="fr_pz4-7">4</a> and options and futures on those ETFs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-8" NAME="fr_pz4-8">5</a> This dispersion of significant trading volume has led the Commission in the past to ask for comment on how best to enhance the capability of SROs and the Commission to effectively and efficiently conduct cross-market supervision of trading activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-9" NAME="fr_pz4-9">6</a></p>
        <p id="81c159b6-39ac-4e46-9b2f-3c7dd1ef1a6d">The individual SROs are responsible for regulating their markets and their members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-3" NAME="fr_pz5-3">7</a> Further, the Commission has responsibilities to oversee the SROs, the securities markets, and registered broker-dealers, and routinely conducts examinations of or investigations into trading activity as part of its oversight and enforcement programs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-4" NAME="fr_pz5-4">8</a> The SROs and the Commission need tools to effectively carry out these responsibilities even when trading occurs on multiple markets. For example, it is important that the SRO and Commission staff have order and trade data sufficient to monitor cross-market trading activity, assist with investigations of potential violations of federal securities laws and exchange rules, and perform market reconstructions or other analysis necessary to understand trading activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-5" NAME="fr_pz5-5">9</a> Such information also is important to the Commission in carrying out its oversight responsibilities.</p>
        <p id="471141ee-768d-4e94-9522-c0fbaea4f7a2">The SROs&#8217; staff currently uses both EBS<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-6" NAME="fr_pz5-6">10</a> and SRO audit trail data to help fulfill their regulatory obligations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-7" NAME="fr_pz5-7">11</a> Commission staff also uses this data to perform its regulatory oversight obligations. The Commission and SROs have depended on the bluesheet system for decades to request trading records from broker-dealers needed for regulatory inquiries. Most SROs also maintain their own specific audit trail requirements applicable to their members. As discussed more fully below, for example, the National Association of Securities Dealers (&#8220;NASD&#8221;)<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-3" NAME="fr_pz6-3">12</a> established the Order Audit Trail System (&#8220;OATS&#8221;)<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-4" NAME="fr_pz6-4">13</a> in 1996, and the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) implemented its Order Tracking System (&#8220;OTS&#8221;)<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-5" NAME="fr_pz6-5">14</a> in 1999. Beginning in 2000, several of the current options exchanges implemented the Consolidated Options Audit Trail System (&#8220;COATS&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-6" NAME="fr_pz6-6">15</a></p>
        <p id="dcef670a-1411-4e10-b3e0-4e704d39f9d4">Currently, there is significant disparity in the audit trail requirements among the exchanges and FINRA, especially with respect to the information captured by each.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-7" NAME="fr_pz7-7">16</a> Further, the information for each must be provided in different formats. The differences result in inconsistent requirements imposed on exchange and FINRA members, and also make it difficult to view trading activity across multiple markets. The lack of uniformity in, and cross-market compatibility of, SRO audit trails can make detection of illegal trading activity carried out across multiple markets and multiple products more difficult. The Commission has voiced concern about the lack of uniformity in, and cross-market compatibility of, the audit trails in the past.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-8" NAME="fr_pz7-8">17</a> The Commission preliminarily believes that these differences may hinder the ability of the SROs and the Commission to effectively view and regulate trading activity across markets.</p>
        <p id="3086a978-95ee-41a3-b458-c627c999b934">Further, risks imposed on the markets by violative conduct can be substantially increased by automated trading, as market participants have the ability to trade numerous products and enormous volume in mere seconds. As trading venues have become more automated, and trading systems have become computerized, trading volumes have increased significantly,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-9" NAME="fr_pz7-9">18</a> and trading has become more dispersed across more trading centers and therefore more difficult to monitor and trace.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-10" NAME="fr_pz7-10">19</a> The Commission is concerned that current audit trail requirements are insufficient to capture in a timely manner all of the information necessary to efficiently and effectively monitor trading activity in today&#8217;s highly automated and dispersed markets. The Commission also is concerned that the current lack of cohesive, readily available order and execution information impacts the ability of the SROs and the Commission staff to effectively perform their respective regulatory and oversight responsibilities with respect to trading activity by market participants across markets and products.</p>

          <p id="a435810c-7852-472a-84da-09ca0b0b8287">One commenter expressed the view that once broker-dealers have implemented systems necessary to comply with audit trail requirements, it would not be incrementally significant from a cost perspective to supply the same data in a common format to additional SROs, but that there would be a significant cost if the data to be captured and the methods of encoding and delivering the data differed from market to market.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-4" NAME="fr_pz26-4">101</a> This commenter urged the Commission, if it were to require all market centers to adopt audit trail requirements, to ensure that the requirements are uniform and standardized. This commenter recommended a single standard for real time electronic trade and audit trail reporting, which would be applicable to all equity securities traded in the national market regardless of where listed or traded, and where data would be captured in a central depository, aggregated and made immediately available to each relevant market center, possibly through direct electronic data feeds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-3" NAME="fr_pz27-3">102</a> Likewise, another commenter stated that it would be preferable for there to be one uniform audit trail system, rather than each SRO adopting its own audit trail requirements and systems, to reduce the potential for conflicting rules and regulations and duplicative systems and technology requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-4" NAME="fr_pz27-4">103</a> Another commenter recommended that if the Commission determined that the need for a particular SRO to have enhanced audit trail information outweighs costs to member firms, SROs be required to coordinate efforts so as to reduce duplication of systems and regulatory efforts.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-5" NAME="fr_pz27-5">104</a></p>

          <p id="bedd66e9-f1a3-43ee-b547-bfa8debd625f">One commenter on the Concept Release Concerning Self-Regulation stated that, because trading in most liquid securities now occurs on multiple markets, no single SRO could capture a complete picture of all the trading in each product, all trading by one broker-dealer, and even all the trading related to a single order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-7" NAME="fr_pz29-7">116</a> This commenter stated its belief that the lack of uniform order and transaction data creates regulatory gaps and may provide incentives for market participants to conduct activities on markets where less regulatory data is collected on an automated basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-8" NAME="fr_pz29-8">117</a> This commenter believed that minimum data-collection standards should be required to ensure adequate regulation across all markets, and that consolidating that data would permit effective intermarket regulation while ensuring that no single market has a competitive advantage.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-9" NAME="fr_pz29-9">118</a></p>
          <p id="b1b92c79-8eee-4a2b-90ee-885ceafaf88d">Another commenter gave an example of how it believed the lack of real time reporting across markets was detrimental to surveillances relating to certain illegal activities. This commenter stated its belief that &#8220;effective surveillances relating to insider trading, market manipulation and stock or options frontrunning in multiple markets can be hindered because away-market data such as order information, position limit reports and large position reports (for options) are not available electronically on a real time or near real time basis to the SRO that has generated an alert or flag in the course of its routine surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-3" NAME="fr_pz30-3">119</a> This commenter suggested that consolidating this type of data in real time or near real time would permit SROs to immediately detect and review all aberrational activity in the multiple market centers, which could significantly deter or prevent violative conduct.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-4" NAME="fr_pz30-4">120</a></p>
          <p id="7aaa2c0f-cd73-4e8c-8d8f-388a1ae90cca">Another commenter stated its belief that the lack of a coordinated surveillance system is potentially one of the more significant problems facing the markets, and that as trading strategies become more sophisticated across multiple markets and national borders, the potential for sophisticated fraud also increases.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-5" NAME="fr_pz30-5">121</a> One commenter recommended a consolidated information base that all regulators could access, stating that &#8220;having separate and uncoordinated regulatory data is inefficient and detracts from the quality of regulation.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-6" NAME="fr_pz30-6">122</a> Further, another commenter suggested a voluntary regulatory cooperative, jointly owned by participant exchanges, that would be the central regulator for surveillance, investigations and examinations and would include an electronic interface with the SEC; this commenter believed that the costs of developing an intermarket consolidated order audit trail system should be justified by the regulatory value of the data to be captured.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-6" NAME="fr_pz31-6">123</a></p>

        <p id="e6e07357-57c0-4805-9f12-0521d45f3468">As noted above, the U.S. securities markets have experienced a dynamic transformation in recent years. Rapid technological advances and regulatory developments have produced fundamental changes in the structure of the securities markets, the types of market participants, the trading strategies employed, and the array of products traded. Trading of securities has become more dispersed among exchanges and various other trading venues, including the OTC market. The markets have become even more competitive, with exchanges and other trading centers aggressively competing for order flow by offering innovative order types, new data products and other services, and through fees charged or rebates provided by the markets. The Commission preliminarily believes that with today&#8217;s fast, electronic and interconnected markets, there is a heightened need for a single uniform electronic cross-market order and execution tracking system that includes more information than is captured by the existing SRO audit trails, and in a uniform format. Such a system would enable SROs to better fulfill their regulatory responsibilities to monitor for and investigate illegal activity in their markets and by their members. Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that such a system would enable the Commission staff to better carry out its oversight of the NMS for securities and to perform market analysis in a more timely fashion, whether on one market or across markets.</p>
        <p id="1116c212-d107-455f-9e09-db70856e8693">Each national securities exchange and national securities association must be organized and have the capacity to comply, and enforce compliance by its members, with its rules, and with the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-3" NAME="fr_pz32-3">124</a> The Commission preliminarily believes that the exchanges and FINRA could more effectively and efficiently fulfill these statutory obligations if the SROs had direct, electronic real time access to consolidated and more detailed order and execution information across all markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-4" NAME="fr_pz32-4">125</a> Likewise, the Commission has the statutory obligation to oversee the exchanges and associations,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-5" NAME="fr_pz32-5">126</a> and to enforce compliance by the members of exchanges and associations with the respective exchange&#8217;s or association&#8217;s rules, and the federal securities laws and regulations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-6" NAME="fr_pz32-6">127</a> The Commission also preliminarily believes that electronic real time access to consolidated information and more detailed cross market order and execution information also would aid the Commission in carrying out its statutory obligations.</p>

In effect, the proposal would create a time-stamped &#8220;electronic audit trail record or report&#8221; for every order, and each market participant that touches the order would be required to report information about certain reportable events, such as routing or execution of the order.</p>
        <p id="987ec0e0-911f-4a87-8c85-bb7c24bafef0">The Commission preliminarily believes that a consolidated order audit trail, such as the one proposed today, could enhance the ability of the SROs to carry out their obligations to regulate their markets and their members. The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated order audit trail could aid the Commission in fulfilling its statutory obligations to oversee SROs,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-5" NAME="fr_pz33-5">130</a> monitor for the manipulation of security prices,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-7" NAME="fr_pz33-7">131</a> and detect the use of manipulative or deceptive devices in the purchase or sale of a security,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-8" NAME="fr_pz33-8">132</a> as well as to perform market reconstructions.</p>
        <p id="e3283b2f-f4b9-41b1-ae82-5dad515ab37a">The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would benefit the industry, through potential cost reductions, by eliminating the need for certain SRO and Commission rules that currently mandate the collection and provision of information, at least with respect to NMS securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-9" NAME="fr_pz33-9">133</a> The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposal would benefit SROs, as well as the NMS for NMS securities, by ultimately reducing some regulatory costs, which may result in a more effective re-allocation of overall costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-5" NAME="fr_pz34-5">134</a></p>
        <p id="528b3e0c-1695-4b3e-9e2b-2bcd4f5157a1">The Commission recognizes that SRO rules requiring members to capture and disclose audit trail information already exist, and considered whether more modest improvements to existing rules, and corresponding SRO and member systems, would achieve the proposed Rule&#8217;s objective at lower cost. For example, the Commission considered whether to standardize and expand the order information collected by existing audit trails, the EBS system, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> and equity cleared reports. Without centralization of the trading data in a uniform electronic format, however, the Commission&#8217;s goals of cross-market comparability and ready access could not be achieved. Additionally, this approach would not resolve concerns over how long it takes to obtain order and execution information because the data is often not available in real time and is provided only upon request.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-6" NAME="fr_pz34-6">135</a> Similarly, the Commission considered whether assuring access to existing audit trails to other SROs and the Commission would sufficiently advance its goals. Even if SROs could view order activity on a real time basis on other exchanges, this would not eliminate the need for SROs to check multiple repositories to view and obtain order information. Moreover, the information may be captured, stored and displayed in a variety of formats, making comparisons more difficult. The Commission, therefore, preliminarily does not believe that &#8220;retrofitting&#8221; existing rules and systems would be a more effective way to achieve the goals of the proposed consolidated audit trail than having the requirements contained in a single Commission rule, and a single NMS plan.</p>
        <p id="694ffe1d-4087-423e-88c9-40d5df00b32a">As discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that existing audit trails are limited in their scope and effectiveness in varying ways. SRO and Commission staff also currently obtain information about orders or trades through the EBS system, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-4" NAME="fr_pz35-4">136</a> and from equity cleared reports.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-5" NAME="fr_pz35-5">137</a> However, as discussed below, the information provided pursuant to the EBS system, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>, and the equity cleared reports also is limited, to varying degrees, in detail and scope.</p>

          <p id="c091d701-050c-45c3-a907-4ab3d4748a69">As noted above, the type of information relating to orders and executions currently collected by the exchanges and FINRA differs widely. For example, FINRA&#8217;s OATS rules and NYSE/NYSE Amex&#8217;s OTS rules (as supplemented by the requirements of NYSE and <a href="http://wallstreet.cch.com/NYSETools/PlatformViewer.asp?selectednode=chp_1_3_8_12&amp;manual=%2Fnyse%2Frules%2Fnyse-rules%2F">NYSE Amex Rule 123</a>) both set forth in relative detail the information required to be recorded by a FINRA, NYSE or NYSE Amex member upon receipt or origination of an order; following transmission of an order to another FINRA, NYSE or NYSE Amex member; and following modification, cancellation or execution of such order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-6" NAME="fr_pz35-6">138</a> In contrast, some other exchanges&#8217; rules only require their members to keep records in compliance with the member&#8217;s recordkeeping obligations under <a href="">Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act</a> and rules thereunder,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-7" NAME="fr_pz35-7">139</a> rather than requiring that specific information be captured for orders sent to and executed on the exchange.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-8" NAME="fr_pz35-8">140</a> Although <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3d8a335242b627ded4f45fb5e1a3192f&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_63">Rule 17a-3</a> under the Exchange Act<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-9" NAME="fr_pz35-9">141</a> requires that a member make and keep detailed information with respect to each brokerage order, it does not, for instance, require information with respect to the routing of the order, or that each order be assigned a unique order identifier.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-3" NAME="fr_pz36-3">142</a> Similarly, the scope of securities covered by existing audit trail rules also differs among the exchanges and FINRA. FINRA&#8217;s OATS rules, for instance, apply to orders for equity securities listed on Nasdaq and OTC securities, while OTS captures information for orders in NYSE and NYSE Amex-listed cash equity securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-4" NAME="fr_pz36-4">143</a></p>
          <p id="b0a8a69c-223f-47f3-9ab4-c36db0a61b33">While there is no current requirement that all SROs record the same information for orders and executions in the same or different securities, each SRO has a statutory obligation to regulate its market and its members. The Commission is concerned that the lack of uniformity as to the type of audit trail information gathered by the different exchanges and FINRA, and the lack of compatibility in the format of each SRO&#8217;s audit trail data, may hinder the ability of SRO and Commission staff to effectively and efficiently monitor for, detect, and deter illegal trading that occurs across markets. If a market participant is engaging in manipulative behavior across various markets, but the rules of one market do not require its members to provide detailed information regarding the orders sent to its market, it may be difficult for regulators to determine that trading activity on one market was related to trading activity on another market. For example, <a href="">Section 9 of the Exchange Act</a> expressly prohibits "wash sales."<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-3" NAME="fr_pz37-3">144</a> A trader could attempt to disguise such trading by executing various legs of wash transactions on different markets. Individual market surveillance based on individual SRO audit trail data would not always be able to detect this kind of cross-market abuse.</p>
          <p id="a239d9c5-1442-4811-b5db-691270f90aca">Further, while current order audit trail rules provide a framework for capturing order information, the Commission is concerned that certain information about orders and executions that would be useful to efficient and effective regulation of inter-market trading activity and prevention of manipulative practices is not captured by existing audit trails. Most importantly, the existing audit trails do not require members to provide information identifying the customer submitting an order, the person with investment discretion for the order, or the beneficial owner. The identity of this &#8220;ultimate customer,&#8221; however, often is necessary to tie together potential manipulative activity that occurs across markets and through multiple accounts at various broker-dealers. While the Commission notes that exchange and FINRA regulatory staff, as well as Commission staff, eventually can obtain identifying customer or beneficial account information by submitting requests for information through ISG or to various broker-dealers involved in potentially wrongful activities, this process can result in significant delays in investigating market anomalies or potentially manipulative behavior. The Commission preliminarily believes that gaps such as this in required audit trail information may hinder the ability of regulatory authorities to enforce compliance with SRO rules and the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations in a timely manner.</p>
          <p id="048d2dff-fae0-417b-b7f7-a5c398ad54a8">In addition, an exchange&#8217;s audit trail information effectively ends when an order is routed to another exchange. For example, although the NYSE&#8217;s OTS rule requires a NYSE member or member organization to record the fact that an order was transmitted to a non-member, the rules do not require the recording of what subsequently happens to the order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-3" NAME="fr_pz38-3">145</a> Likewise, FINRA&#8217;s OATS data collection effectively ends if an order is routed from a member of FINRA to an exchange.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-4" NAME="fr_pz38-4">146</a> As a result, key pieces of information about the life of an order may not be captured, or easily tracked, if an order is routed from one exchange to another, or from one broker-dealer to an exchange. For example, the name, or identifier, of a broker-dealer that initially received an order may be captured by the audit trail of the exchange of which that broker-dealer is a member when the broker-dealer sends the order to the exchange. However, if the order is routed to and executed on a second exchange, the identifying information for that initial broker-dealer may not be captured by the second exchange&#8217;s audit trail requirements.</p>
          <p id="0824ed86-7b2d-41c8-9d93-f7599a802b88">Similarly, under current audit trail rules, an incoming order may be assigned an order identifier by the initial receiving exchange; however, if the order is routed to a second exchange, there is no requirement that this order identifier be passed along to or maintained by the second exchange. Thus, one order that is routed across markets can have multiple order identifiers, each unique to one exchange. The Commission preliminarily believes that, from a regulatory standpoint, the lack of standardized cross-market order identifiers can pose significant obstacles and delays in effectively detecting and deterring manipulative behavior because SRO and Commission staff cannot readily collect the necessary data (that is, they cannot readily piece together activity related to the same order or the same customer occurring across several markets) to determine whether violative behavior has occurred.</p>
          <p id="3dde93c6-0709-4a24-af51-84cabf0288c6">Additionally, the Commission is concerned that the data generated by the EBS system or that is available through the equity cleared reports also lacks items of information needed to match up order and trade information across markets to fully understand a particular trading pattern or to reconstruct a certain type of trading activity. EBS data does not include the time of execution, and often does not include the identity of the beneficial owner.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-3" NAME="fr_pz39-3">147</a> The equity cleared data also lacks the time of execution, as well as time of order receipt, often the identity of the beneficial owner, the identity of the broker-dealer(s) that received and/or executed the order (if different from the clearing broker-dealer), and short sale borrow and fails information. In order to obtain the time an order was received or the identity of the beneficial owner, therefore, SRO or Commission staff may take the additional step of submitting an electronically generated blue sheet request to the clearing broker-dealer identified in the equity cleared report to ask that broker-dealer to identify the beneficial ownership of the account(s) effecting the relevant transactions and/or the introducing broker,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-4" NAME="fr_pz39-4">148</a> and this may take a few steps if the clearing broker-dealer does not know the introducing broker, but only the executing broker (if different). If the beneficial ownership of the account(s) was not specified in the clearing broker-dealer&#8217;s response, the staff could then ask the introducing broker-dealer for the time an order was received and the beneficial account holder information. Often, additional steps are required to identify the beneficial account holder, such as when the &#8220;customer&#8221; is an omnibus account. Furthermore, the equity cleared data could be duplicative. For example, one side of a trade can appear multiple times in the equity cleared reports because it may be reported by a specialist, a clearing broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer holding the customer&#8217;s allocation account and the customer&#8217;s trading account.</p>
          <p id="16dddd36-a093-4b19-a9e4-0e5d4cc059f9">The lack of cohesive, readily available order and execution information creates significant hurdles for investigators at both the SROs and at the Commission. In order for SROs to investigate potential violations of their rules and the federal securities laws and rules by their members, the SROs should have the ability to analyze the activities of their members taking place across different market centers. This requires the accumulation and interpretation of data from numerous, disparate sources sometimes presenting inconsistent information. Similarly, the experience of the Commission staff shows that the lack of a consolidated audit trail results in the investment of significant resources to investigate potential market abuses. For example, when investigating potential insider trading and other market manipulations, Commission staff first obtains an equity cleared report to identify the clearing broker-dealers for trades involving the stock under investigation and the trading volume for a particular period of time. Then staff sends document requests to those clearing broker-dealers to identify the broker-dealers that executed trades in the stock over that period of time. This process can be complicated further by potential market manipulators that trade through small introducing brokers or use offshore corporate accounts and prime brokerage or other arrangements to conduct transactions. Commission staff also may request trade data for additional time periods identified during the course of the investigation, resulting in further delays. Commission staff thus often must make multiple requests to broker-dealers to obtain sufficient order information about the purchase or sale of a specific security to be able to adequately analyze trading. These multiple requests and responses can take a significant amount of time and delay the Commission's efforts to analyze the data on an expedited basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-3" NAME="fr_pz41-3">149</a> While the investigative protocols of each SRO may differ from those used by the Commission, in each case, collecting, interpreting and analyzing diverse data sources is labor intensive and time consuming.</p>
          <p id="5549f044-b7c9-4200-9adb-697766b91fea">The Commission is concerned that inadequacies in the current audit trail rules, EBS system, and equity cleared reports also impede the ability of SRO or Commission staff to promptly analyze trading patterns, particularly to prepare market reconstructions. For example, if Commission staff wants to undertake an analysis of an extreme market movement over a limited period of time, Commission staff would need to analyze audit trail information and EBS submissions of trading data to determine if specific trading strategies, techniques or participants appeared to be associated with the movement. Because of difficulties in linking trades in the audit trails with aggregate day-end trading data in EBS submissions, conducting this analysis is difficult and time-consuming. While the audit trail data could identify the precise execution times of trades by particular clearing broker-dealers, it would not identify the specific customers or beneficial owners involved in the trades. On the other hand, while EBS submissions provide summary trading information for particular accounts at the clearing broker-dealers, they lack execution times for these trades. Further complications can arise due to the common practice for large traders to route their orders through multiple accounts at multiple clearing firms, as well as practices at some firms that use &#8220;average price accounts&#8221; to effect trades that are eventually settled in multiple proprietary and/or customer accounts. While these practices are not, in themselves, improper, their use makes it more challenging to establish with certainty when trading on behalf of a particular trader was effected during the trading session.</p>
          <p id="a08b94ea-76f6-4b8c-b8e2-070f24418e44">The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would help alleviate the difficulties faced by Commission staff in performing market reconstructions, such as those described in the above example, by requiring that national securities exchanges, national securities associations, and their members provide order and execution data to one central location, largely on a real time basis, in a uniform electronic format. Having this information readily available in a central location would reduce the need for staff to request and collect such information from multiple broker-dealers and then examine, analyze and reconcile the disparate information provided to accurately &#8220;reconstruct&#8221; the market.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-5" NAME="fr_pz42-5">150</a></p>

The Commission preliminarily believes that end-of-day reporting, coupled with the current laborious process of identifying the ultimate customer responsible for a particular securities transaction that may take several days, weeks or even months, can impact effective oversight by hindering the ability of SRO regulatory staff to identify manipulative activity close in time to when it is occurring, and respond to instances of potential manipulation quickly. This process also hinders the Commission&#8217;s ability to detect and investigate potentially manipulative behavior. Manipulative activity by some market participants can result in other market participants, such as retail investors, losing money. The longer that manipulative behavior goes undetected over time, the greater the potential harm to investors. Further, timely pursuit of potential violations can be important in seeking to freeze and recover any profits received from illegal activity.</p>

In addition, Commission staff itself does not have immediate access to the exchanges&#8217; and FINRA&#8217;s audit trail information, and instead must specifically request that an exchange or FINRA produce its audit trail information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-4" NAME="fr_pz44-4">154</a></p>

          <p id="a3a6ff1f-2369-4e6d-8aa8-07804b282bc6">Although the EBS system and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> can be used to obtain information in conjunction with the SRO audit trail information, the Commission is concerned with the ability of the EBS system, as enhanced by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>, to keep pace with changes in the securities markets over recent years. Various changes in market dynamics have affected the utility of the EBS system and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>. For example, decimal trading has increased the number of price points for securities, and the volume of quotations and orders has correspondingly dramatically increased. Thus, the volume of transaction data subject to reporting under the EBS system can be significantly greater than the EBS system was intended to accommodate in a typical request for data. As a request-based system that is most useful when targeting trading in a specific security for a specific time, the EBS system is not well-suited as a broad-based tool to detect illegal or manipulative activity. The increased use of sponsored access (or other indirect access to an exchange) also has made it more difficult to use the EBS system and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> to identify the ultimate customer that originates an order because the member broker-dealer through whom an order is sent to an exchange may not know the identity of the underlying customer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz45-3" NAME="fr_pz45-3">156</a></p>
          <p id="7c2c31c2-13c4-4ede-943b-966ad46298cc">In addition, the increasing number of alternative trading venues creates more opportunities for orders to be routed to other markets and thus can result in delays in producing EBS data as requests must be made to several broker-dealers in the &#8220;chain&#8221; of an order. Finally, the increased trading of derivative instruments and products also has affected the ongoing effectiveness of the EBS system and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>. A market participant can use derivative instruments and products as a substitute for trading in a particular equity, and likewise engage in illegal trading activity in derivative instruments and products. However, because information related to some derivative instruments over which the Commission has anti-fraud authority (such as security-based swaps) is not included within the EBS data or provided pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>, the EBS system and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> are not effective tools for ascertaining activity in those markets or how that activity may be affecting the underlying equity market.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz46-4" NAME="fr_pz46-4">157</a></p>
          <p id="bb74b337-0b86-4b0c-9eb7-fd1b5f3878e4">In the Commission staff&#8217;s experience, the EBS is most effective when investigating or analyzing trading in a small sample of securities over a limited period of time. But even under those circumstances, Commission staff often must make multiple requests to broker-dealers to obtain sufficient order information about the purchase or sale of a specific security to be able to adequately analyze the suspect trading. These multiple requests and responses can take a significant amount of time. The Commission preliminarily believes that the EBS system may no longer be able to fully support the regulatory challenges currently facing SRO and Commission regulatory staff.</p>
          <p id="17f8d957-f0e5-430f-8bd3-f7e1320b2d92">The consolidated audit trail that the Commission is proposing today would provide significant improvements in the order and execution information available to SRO and Commission staff in several discrete ways. Among other things, the proposed audit trail would require that national securities exchanges and national securities associations and their members submit uniform order and execution information to a central repository on a real time basis, where possible. National securities exchanges and associations, and their member firms, would be required to identify the person with investment discretion for the order, and beneficial account holder, if different, along with other key information about the customer or proprietary desk that placed or originated the order. The proposed consolidated audit trail also would cover any action taken with respect to the order through execution, or cancellation, as applicable, and thus would allow regulators to more easily trace the order from inception to cancellation or execution.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-4" NAME="fr_pz47-4">158</a></p>
          <p id="52a57d33-0e23-44e9-927b-dfde8eecc783">The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed audit trail information would greatly enhance the ability of SRO staff to effectively monitor and surveil the securities markets on a real time basis, and thus to detect and investigate illegal activity in a more timely fashion, whether on one market or across markets. The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposal would improve the ability of Commission and SRO staff to conduct more timely and accurate trading analysis, as well as to conduct more timely and accurate market reconstructions, complex enforcement inquiries or investigations, and inspections and examinations of regulated entities and SROs.</p>

        <p id="38a17958-e07e-455c-bde8-175410c3785a">If adopted, the proposed Rule would require each national securities exchange and national securities association to file jointly with the Commission on or before 90 days from approval of this proposed Rule an NMS plan to govern the creation, implementation, and maintenance of a consolidated audit trail and a central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-4" NAME="fr_pz48-4">161</a> The NMS plan would be required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to, and subject to the requirements of, <a href="">Rule 608 of Regulation NMS</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-5" NAME="fr_pz48-5">162</a> As such, the proposed NMS plan would be published in the Federal Register and subject to public notice and comment in accordance with <a href="">Rule 608(b)</a>.

        <p id="7f688b3c-82a4-482c-b287-58829b23162f">The Commission would expect the exchanges and FINRA to cooperate with each other and to take joint action as necessary to develop, file, and ultimately implement a single NMS plan to fulfill this requirement. The Commission requests comment on this approach. Specifically, the Commission requests comment on whether requiring the exchanges and associations to act jointly by filing an NMS plan that would contain the requirements for a consolidated audit trail is the most effective and efficient way to achieve the objectives of a consolidated audit trail. Or, should the Commission require the exchanges and associations to standardize or otherwise enhance their existing rules? What approach would be most efficient in improving the ability to monitor cross-market trading, or undertake market analysis or reconstructions, and why?</p>
        <p id="0a655e8e-a49c-4f15-9cac-ae0f00641fb8">As discussed in further detail below, the proposed Rule would require that the NMS plan include provisions regarding: (1) the operation and administration of the NMS plan; (2) the creation and oversight of a central repository; (3) the data required to be provided by SROs and their members to the central repository; (4) clock synchronization; (5) compliance by national securities exchanges, FINRA, and their members with the proposed Rule and the NMS plan; and (6) the possible expansion of the NMS plan to products other than NMS securities.</p>
        <p id="6356f270-be4f-4299-9027-374a17182727">The proposed Rule is designed to allow the national securities exchanges and national securities associations to develop the details of the NMS plan that they believe should govern the creation, implementation and maintenance of the central repository and consolidated audit trail, within the parameters set forth in the proposed Rule. The Commission believes that the national securities exchanges and national securities associations working jointly are in the best position to propose for themselves and their members the specifics of how the consolidated audit trail should be structured and administered. To this end, the proposed Rule contains a broad framework within which the exchanges and associations would provide the details that they believe would result in a functional, cooperative mechanism to create and maintain a consolidated audit trail, as well as certain explicit requirements the NMS plan must meet. As noted above, the proposed NMS plan developed by the exchanges and FINRA would be subject to public comment and approval by the Commission.</p>

Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that it would be beneficial to provide for the possible expansion of the consolidated audit trail to include information on primary market transactions in NMS stocks and other equity securities that are not NMS stocks, as well as primary market transactions in debt securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-2" NAME="fr_pz51-2">167</a> Such information could be used to monitor for violations of certain rules under the Exchange Act, such as Regulation M and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_110b_65">Rule 10b-5</a> under the Exchange Act.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-3" NAME="fr_pz51-3">168</a> Further, FINRA&#8217;s transaction reporting requirements for debt securities already cover primary market transactions in debt securities,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-5" NAME="fr_pz51-5">169</a> and thus FINRA members should already be recording information relating to such transactions that could be included in an audit trail. The Commission proposes that the scope of the Rule initially be limited to secondary market transactions in NMS securities, however, to allow for a manageable implementation of the proposed consolidated audit trail, and because market participants already have experience with audit trails for these types of transactions in these securities.</p>
          <p id="fcd68b47-a337-410c-9856-698861b2d79f">As discussed above, the Commission believes that implementing a consolidated audit trail for NMS securities would aid the SROs in more effectively and efficiently carrying out their regulatory responsibilities. It would also assist the Commission in carrying out its statutory responsibilities. The Commission further preliminarily believes that a timely expansion of the scope of the consolidated audit trail beyond NMS securities would be beneficial, as illegal trading strategies that the consolidated audit trail would be designed to help detect and deter, such as insider trading, may involve trading in multiple related products other than NMS securities across multiple markets.</p>
          <p id="e1f49599-e84d-490d-9798-0be9a75db8dc">For example, the Commission routinely receives information relating to possible upward manipulation of security prices in violation of <a href="">Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act</a>,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz52-4" NAME="fr_pz52-4">170</a> and alleged abusive short selling in the over-the-counter market, which includes FINRA&#8217;s Bulletin Board and Pink Sheets. If the consolidated audit trail were expanded to cover these securities, it would be possible for SROs and the Commission to make comparisons between current and historical data in a more timely manner than is currently possible, to more quickly determine whether or not a complaint merits additional attention and the corresponding commitment of enforcement resources. Similarly, to the extent that instruments currently not considered NMS securities can be substitutes for long or short positions in NMS securities, having access to an audit trail that documents trading activity in such securities would improve the Commission's ability to make a risk assessment as to information it has received about possibly manipulative activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz53-3" NAME="fr_pz53-3">171</a> Having ready access to this information in an audit trail also would improve the Commission's inspection process because it would enhance risk assessment and allow for better selection as to which broker-dealers to examine. For example, the information would allow for better trend analysis and outlier identification. It also would improve pre-examination work and the asset verification process,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz53-4" NAME="fr_pz53-4">172</a> and focus document requests, making the examination process more efficient for the Commission staff and the registrants subject to the process.</p>
          <p id="98c78d52-9a06-4159-86b8-0e0e0cb1e827">To help ensure that such an expansion would occur in a reasonable time and that the systems and technology that would be used to implement the Rule as proposed are designed to be easily scalable, proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a> would require that the NMS plan contain a provision requiring each national securities exchange and national securities association that is a sponsor of the plan<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz53-5" NAME="fr_pz53-5">173</a> to jointly provide the Commission a document outlining how the sponsors could incorporate into the consolidated audit trail information with respect to: (1) equity securities that are not NMS securities; (2) debt securities, including asset-backed securities; and (3) primary market transactions in NMS stocks, equity securities that are not NMS securities, and debt securities. The sponsors specifically would be required to address, among other things, details for each order and reportable event that they would recommend requiring to be provided; which market participants would be required to provide the data; an implementation timeline; and a cost estimate.</p>
          <p id="818320f4-4f14-4d1a-8e5b-85bd1489a4a2">The Commission requests comment on the proposed scope of products to be covered by the consolidated audit trail. Should the consolidated audit trail initially cover securities other than NMS securities? Why or why not? The Commission also requests comment on whether the approach to expand the consolidated audit trail to include the products and transactions specified above represents an appropriate expansion of the consolidated audit trail, and what additional capital commitment would be required by the various market participants to implement such an expansion. Please be specific in your response with respect to different products or transactions (e.g. security-based swaps, or primary market transactions in NMS stocks). Are there other securities or products that should be identified and included in a future expansion? What would be the challenges to any expansion to the products and transactions listed above? Are there any other actions that the Commission or SROs would need to take to be able to expand the audit trail to certain products or transactions? Should the Commission consider expansion to certain products or transactions before others? The Commission also requests comment on an appropriate and realistic time frame for including these other products and transactions in the consolidated audit trail and whether an expansion should be done in phases.</p>
          <p id="b79f0e2b-cd14-4b41-a007-0d6c6e7a72f2">The Commission also requests comment on whether implementation of the proposed Rule, which would apply to NMS securities, would have an impact on trading activity by market participants in products not initially covered by the proposed Rule. The proposed consolidated audit trail is designed to provide the SROs and the Commission a tool to more effectively, and in a more timely manner, identify potential manipulative or other illegal activity. More timely detection and investigation of such activity may lead to greater deterrence of future illegal activity if potential wrongdoers perceive a greater chance of regulators identifying their activity in a more timely fashion. Do commenters believe that the existence of the proposed audit trail would alter market participants&#8217; trading behavior, such as by shifting their trading to products or markets not covered by the proposed Rule to avoid detection of illegal activity using consolidated audit trail data? Would the proposal impact a market participant&#8217;s analysis of the potential risks and benefits of manipulative activity involving NMS securities? If so, how so? In addition, to the extent commenters believe that market participants may alter their trading behavior, such as by shifting trading to products that are not initially covered by the proposed Rule to avoid detection of manipulative activity, the Commission requests comment on the importance of expanding the consolidated audit trail to cover additional products.</p>

          <p id="f420a082-4956-4c87-9068-60ccf9116783">The proposed Rule would require that information be provided to the central repository for every order in an NMS security originated or received by a member of an exchange or FINRA. The proposed Rule would define &#8220;order&#8221; to mean: (1) any order received by a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association from any person; (2) any order originated by a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association; or (3) any bid or offer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-4" NAME="fr_pz55-4">174</a> Thus, the proposed consolidated audit trail would cover all orders (whether for a customer or for a member&#8217;s own account) as well as quotations in NMS stocks and listed options.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-3" NAME="fr_pz56-3">175</a> Each member would be required to report to the central repository the origination of its own orders or quotations, and the SRO to which the member sends its orders and quotations would be required to report receipt and execution, if applicable, of those orders and quotations. Because the origination of the quotations would already be reported to the central repository by the member, an SRO would not be required to separately submit to the central repository its best bids and offers that it is required to submit to the central processors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-4" NAME="fr_pz56-4">176</a></p>
          <p id="b0c53ca3-41e3-44c1-b10c-7781e159c324">The Commission preliminarily believes that the inclusion of orders for a member's own account ("proprietary orders") and their bids and offers in the scope of the consolidated audit trail is necessary and appropriate to effectively and efficiently carry out the stated objectives of the consolidated audit trail. The SROs would not be able to use the consolidated audit trail data to surveil trading by broker-dealers through their proprietary accounts if that information is not included in the audit trail. Further, including proprietary orders and quotations in the consolidated audit trail would permit SROs to harness the intended benefits of the consolidated audit trail to more efficiently monitor for violations of SRO rules where the exact sequence of the receipt and execution of customers orders in relation to the creation and execution of proprietary orders or quotations is important to determine whether or not a violation occurred. For example, SROs would be able to use the consolidated audit trail data to more efficiently monitor for instances where a broker-dealer receives a customer order, then sends a proprietary order to one exchange or updates its quotations on an exchange prior to sending the customer order to another exchange, in possible violation of the trading ahead prohibitions in their rules.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-5" NAME="fr_pz56-5">177</a></p>
          <p id="7694091f-8335-4ebc-af5e-dfb6430e873d">Another example where information on proprietary orders or quotations would be useful to have included in the consolidated audit trail is in the investigation of a possible &#8220;spoofing&#8221; allegation. In those cases, a market participant enters and may immediately cancel limit orders or quotations in a specific security with the intent of having those non-bona fide orders or quotations change the national best bid and national best offer (&#8220;NBBO&#8221;). Because a market participant could conduct this activity across multiple markets, using different accounts, the lack of consolidated data makes it much more difficult to identify the source of the orders or quotations and thus to determine whether the quoted price was manipulated or simply responding to market forces. The Commission therefore preliminarily believes that having information on proprietary orders and quotations in the consolidated audit trail along with customer order information would greatly enhance the ability of the SROs to detect potentially violative activity.</p>
          <p id="c16df74a-e864-427c-8ef2-9af4910738d9">The Commission requests comment on its proposed definition of "order" and the scope of the proposed consolidated audit trail. Specifically, the definition would include orders received and originated by SRO members, as well as quotations originated by SRO members. Should it include quotations? Why or why not? Are there any differences between orders and quotations that should be taken into account with respect to the information that would be required to be provided to the central repository with respect to each bid or offer, or with respect to how, or which entity, should be required to report quotation information to the central repository? For example, the Commission understands that out-of-the-money options generate a high volume of automated quotation updates to reflect changes in the price of the underlying security, yet these series often have very little trading activity. Should this type of quotation be required to be submitted to the central repository? If not, is there any way to distinguish these quotations from other quotations that commenters believe should be reported, such as quotations generated by a profit-seeking algorithm? What is the magnitude of quotation data compared to order data and trade data, for both NMS stocks and listed options? Please provide any empirical data. Would there be a significant cost savings to the submission and collection of certain quotation information (for example, quotations in listed options) by end-of-day instead of in real time? If so, please quantify.</p>
          <p id="b363c965-ffcb-4846-90b4-9f47828d6627">The Commission also requests comment with respect to including proprietary orders as well as customer orders in the scope of the consolidated audit trail. Specifically, are there any differences between customer orders and proprietary orders that should be taken into account with respect to the information that would be required to be provided to the central repository with respect to proprietary orders? The Commission also requests comment on how, if at all, the consolidated audit trail should take into account instances where an SRO's quotations (which can include orders received from members as well as quotations) are not actionable, such as when an exchange has a systems failure. Should non-firm quotations be marked in the consolidated audit trail to show they are not firm? If so, how would that be accomplished where it is the exchange making the determination its quotations are not firm, not the member that submitted the order or quotation?</p>

Regulators therefore could more easily and quickly identify manipulative or other undesirable activity. Having the information available in real time would allow the staff of the SROs to run certain cross-market surveillances in real time to ascertain whether anomalous trading activity is occurring, and the SROs could then more quickly begin an investigation into the suspected anomalous trading. Timely pursuit of potential violations can be important in seeking to freeze any profits received from illegal activity before they are spent or otherwise become unreachable (for instance, by being transferred out of the country).

Are there categories of information that would be easier to produce on a real time basis than others? What types of systems modifications by the exchanges, FINRA, and their respective members would be necessary to collect and submit the required audit trail information to the central repository on a real time basis? Please respond with specificity. The Commission further requests comment on whether the requirement to report information in real time should be limited to a specific time period during the day, such as when the markets for trading NMS stocks and listed options are open for trading? Or some other time period? How much lower would the cost be to submit data in real time during trading hours than during the whole day? Or some other time period?

If the exchange executed the order on its trading system(s), the exchange would be required to report that execution of the order (with the required information) to the central repository, but the member would not also be required to report the execution of the order to the central repository. If the member executed the order in the over-the-counter market, however, rather than routing the order to an exchange (or other market center) for execution, the member would be required to report the execution of the order to the central repository.</p>

While <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> requires broker-dealers to electronically submit information about customer and proprietary securities trading, such information is required to be submitted to the Commission only upon request. The Commission preliminarily believes that the usefulness of audit trail information for purposes of effective enforcement and cross-market surveillance of trading activity would be greatly improved by having the identity of the customer electronically attached to the report of the receipt or origination of each order that is sent to the central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz65-10" NAME="fr_pz65-10">192</a></p>
              <p id="69b0019a-2135-4699-86a6-dcb94a014057">The proposed Rule would require that the NMS plan require, for the receipt or origination of an order, the provision to the central repository of information of sufficient detail to identify the customer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz65-11" NAME="fr_pz65-11">193</a> The Commission preliminarily believes that the customer name and address would be sufficient detail to identify the customer. In addition, the proposed Rule would require the provision of customer account information, which would be defined in proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(j)(2)</a> to include but not be limited to: (1) the account number; (2) account type (e.g. options); (3) customer type (e.g., retail, mutual fund, broker-dealer proprietary); (4) the date the account was opened; and (5) the large trader identifier (if applicable).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz65-12" NAME="fr_pz65-12">194</a> The Commission preliminarily believes that information on the type of account and when it was opened would be important to investigations of potential insider trading. For example, knowing when in time the customer opened the account in relation to the suspicious trading activity, or whether the customer changed account authorization to permit options trading just before suspicious options trading, could be evidence of intent. The Commission notes that currently any member receiving orders from a customer would be required, as part of its compliance with its books and records requirements,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz66-3" NAME="fr_pz66-3">195</a> to take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure the accuracy of the customer information received. This should not change, if this proposal were adopted, with respect to customer information recorded and provided to the central repository.</p>
              <p id="3ee14d82-a7ac-4530-bb75-13575c9c0f05">The proposed Rule also would require a unique customer identifier for each customer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz66-4" NAME="fr_pz66-4">196</a> The unique customer identifier should remain constant for each customer, and have the same format, across all broker-dealers. This unique customer identifier would serve a similar purpose to a customer&#8217;s social security number or tax identification number, obviating the need to include that information in the consolidated audit trail data. The Commission is not proposing to mandate the method for achieving this requirement, so as to allow those entities subject to the proposed Rule flexibility to determine the most practical way to accomplish the requirement of having unique customer identifiers. However, one alternative could be to have the central repository be responsible for assigning a unique customer identifier in response to an input by a member of a customer&#8217;s social security number or tax identification number. If the customer already has been assigned a unique identifier because of a prior request by another member, the central repository would provide to the member that same identifier. If no unique identifier has previously been assigned, the central repository could assign a new one. Access to this part of the central repository&#8217;s functionality could be more tightly controlled than access to the consolidated audit trail data, to help ensure the confidentiality of the social security or tax identification numbers.</p>
              <p id="294dc65e-4f97-4d43-aa7f-d2d254b35d50">The Commission requests comment as to whether each item of information regarding the customer is necessary for an effective consolidated audit trail. Is there any additional data that should be included to help identify the customer submitting the order? The Commission also requests comment on the proposed definition of customer. For example, should the definition only include the person exercising investment discretion? Should the definition include the beneficial owner? Should the customer information requirement also include a unique identifier for the particular computer algorithm used by the firm to generate the order, if applicable? Is there a better way to identify in the audit trail individual algorithmically-generated trading strategies? Should each trading desk at a member be required to have its own unique customer identifier, to the extent the trading desk is originating orders for the account of the member? This information on specific algorithms or trading desks could be useful to focus an inspection or investigation, if regulators could tell from the audit trail data that there was a pattern of suspicious trading activity from a specific algorithm or desk.</p>
              <p id="23157948-931f-4db1-809c-5f4833c9e39f">The Commission requests comment as to what systems modifications, if any, would be required for members to collect and to provide this customer identification information to the central repository. Do broker-dealers currently keep this information electronically? If not, what changes would need to be made to collect and provide this information for existing accounts to the central repository? What would be the cost of converting this information into an electronic, accessible and linked format? Please be specific in your response. Further, the Commission requests comment on whether there are laws or other regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions that would limit or prohibit a member from obtaining the proposed customer information for non-U.S. customers. If so, what are they? How do members currently obtain such information for such customers? If there are special difficulties in obtaining customer information from non-US jurisdictions, how should the consolidated audit trail be modified or otherwise reflect that difficulty?</p>
              <p id="64fd6f7e-7480-40a3-922f-23de6f3672ad">The Commission requests comment on other possible ways to develop and implement unique customer identifiers. For example, who should be responsible for generating the identifier? The Commission also requests comment on whether a unique customer identifier, together with the other information with respect to the customer that would be required to be provided under the proposed Rule, is sufficient to identify individual customers. Are there any concerns about how the customer information will be protected? If so, what steps should be taken to ensure appropriate safeguards with respect to the submission of customer information, as well as the receipt, consolidation, and maintenance of such information in the central repository.</p>
              <p id="1cda220c-9eeb-4fe8-8e88-4e47f800e2ed">In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether the requirement to provide customer information to the central repository in real time would impact market participants' trading activity? If so, how so? For example, would market participants be hesitant to engage in certain legal trading activity because of a concern about providing customer information in real time? Would market participants shift their trading activity to products or markets that do not require the capture of customer information to avoid compliance with this requirement of the proposed Rule? If so, how should the Commission address those concerns? On the other hand, would enhanced surveillance of the markets as a result of the consolidated audit trail attract additional trading volume to the U.S. markets?</p>

              <p id="dce72453-96a4-4074-9b83-a924f13f40be">Each member originating or receiving an order from a customer, and each national securities exchange, national securities association, and member that subsequently handles the order, would be required to include its own unique identifier in each report it sends to the central repository for a reportable event. Such an identifier would allow the Commission and SRO staff to determine which member facilitated the transaction and assist in assessing compliance with various SRO or Commission rules, such as the limit order display rule (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=89804d348e7ae3ab71ff9038a9877188&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1604">Rule 604 of Regulation</a> NMS).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz69-3" NAME="fr_pz69-3">197</a> This is especially important for ensuring that individual customer orders are handled and executed in accordance with SRO and Commission rules. In addition, routing decisions are an important aspect in assessing order execution quality and compliance with a member&#8217;s duty of best execution. Further, if applicable, the member receiving an order from a customer would be required to report an identifier specifying the branch office and the registered representative at the member receiving the order. These identifiers would be unique to the exchange, association, member, branch office, and registered representative.</p>
              <p id="a2d9f92d-9beb-4c59-9247-715875b4952e">The proposed Rule would not require that these unique identifiers "travel" with an order throughout its life, but would require that the unique identifier of each member or SRO that is taking an action with respect to the order be attached to the report of each reportable event that the member, exchange or association is reporting to the central repository. Each report in the life of the order would be able to be linked together at the central repository through the unique order identifier. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily does not believe that the unique identifier of each member or market that touches an order needs to travel with the order for the life of the order as long as the unique identifier of the member or exchange taking the action is included. For example, if Member A receives an order from a customer, Member A would be required to report the receipt of that order to the central repository and include Member A's unique identifier. If Member A then routed that order to another member, Member B, Member A would be required to report the routing of that order to the central repository and include Member A's unique identifier as well as the unique identifier of Member B. Likewise, Member B would be required to report the receipt of that order from Member A to the central repository and include the unique identifiers of Member A and Member B. If Member B then routed the order to Exchange A for execution, Member B would be required to report the routing of the order to the central repository and include the unique identifier of Member B and Exchange A, but not Member A.</p>
              <p id="d368a8d5-f5bd-423d-9e16-f98da9af8c59">The Commission requests comment as to who should be responsible for generating unique identifiers for national securities exchanges, national securities associations, and their members. Would it be feasible for each national securities exchange, national securities association, or member to develop its own identifier for this purpose? The Commission also requests comment on the level of specificity for each unique member identifier &#8211; should it be designed to identify the firm, trading desk or individual registered representative? What are the advantages or disadvantages of requiring a unique identifier that would allow identification of an individual registered representative as opposed to just the member entity? The Commission also requests comment on procedures or safeguards market participants believe are necessary or appropriate so that these unique identifiers are routed accurately.</p>

              <p id="2fc54154-3ae4-4928-bca4-93a905d8c279">The proposed Rule would require the NMS plan to require members of each of the exchanges and FINRA to collect and provide to the central repository certain key items of information about an order as soon as the member receives or originates an order, including the customer information as described above. The proposed Rule would require the member to report the date and time (to the millisecond) that an order was originated or received.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-3" NAME="fr_pz71-3">198</a> The member also would be required to report the material terms of the order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-4" NAME="fr_pz71-4">199</a> Material terms of the order would be defined to include, but not be limited to, the following information: (1) the NMS security symbol; (2) the type of security; (3) price(s) (if applicable); (4) size (displayed and non-displayed); (5) side (buy/sell); (6) order type; (7) if a sell order, whether the order is long, short, or short exempt;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-5" NAME="fr_pz71-5">200</a> (8) if a short sale, the locate identifier; (9) open/close indicator; (10) time in force (if applicable); (11) whether the order is solicited or unsolicited; (12) whether the account has a prior position in the security; (13) if the order is for a listed option, option type (put/call), option symbol or root symbol, underlying symbol, strike price, expiration date, and open/close; and (14) any special handling instructions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-10" NAME="fr_pz71-10">201</a></p>
              <p id="3e988e19-b91d-4801-831b-12355fe44c0b">The information described would assist the SROs, and the Commission as well, in determining the exact time of order receipt or origination, as well as provide a record of all of the original material terms of an order. The entry time of orders can be critical information in enforcement cases. In insider trading investigations, for example, the entry time of the order may be a critical piece of evidence in determining whether or not an individual acted with the requisite scienter to violate the federal securities laws. Similarly, in investigating possible market abuse violations, such as trading ahead of a customer order, the relationship between order origination, the terms of the order, and order entry of various other orders on multiple venues, may be at issue. As noted above, requiring that the time of a reportable event be reported in milliseconds is consistent with current industry standards. The Commission requests comment on whether this is an appropriate time standard. Do commenters believe that the time standard should be shorter? If so, what should be the standard, and why? Would requiring a shorter time standard for reporting actually provide more precision in the timing of events? How would your answer be impacted by the extent to which market participants&#8217; clocks are synchronized? Alternatively, do commenters believe that it would be more appropriate to require in the proposed Rule that the time of reporting be consistent with industry standards, rather than including a specific time standard (recognizing that the SROs could choose to include a specific time standard in the NMS plan)?</p>
              <p id="7439ac8e-6d15-47ae-9a55-aa97750d1199">An open/close indicator currently is required to be submitted to exchanges for listed option orders<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz72-3" NAME="fr_pz72-3">202</a> and indicates whether the trade is opening a new position or increasing an existing position rather than closing or decreasing an existing position. The open/close indicator provides information to more easily track the size and holding time for individual positions, and thus to more easily track open interest and short interest. In addition, an open/close indicator could be used to indicate when a buy order in a stock is a buy to cover on a short sale. This information is useful in investigating short selling abuses and short squeezes. For example, a build up of a large short position by one investor along with the spreading of rumors may be indicative of using short selling as a tool to potentially manipulate prices. Information on when the position decreases is also useful for indicating potential manipulation, insider trading, or other rule violations. Information on whether the account has a prior position in the security is useful in a number of investigations. For example, the ability to easily determine whether an order adds to a position, along with the timing of the order, is particularly important in detecting and investigating portfolio pumping or marking the close. Also, information on whether the account has a prior position may be important in investigating &#8220;layering&#8221; or &#8220;spoofing.&#8221; Layering and spoofing are manipulations where orders are placed close to the best buy or sell price with no intention to trade in an effort to falsely overstate the liquidity in a security.</p>
              <p id="f4626c33-0d7e-4de4-b0cb-42497dddf44c">The Commission intends that the items of information required to be reported to the central repository for the receipt or origination of an order, at a minimum, include substantially all of the information currently required to be reported, or provided upon request, under the exchanges&#8217; and FINRA&#8217;s existing order audit trail rules, as well as the EBS system rules and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> under the Exchange Act. The Commission requests comment as to whether there are any items of information that are required to be recorded and reported by existing audit trail rules, or to be provided to the SROs or Commission upon request, that are not included within the proposed Rule that commenters believe should be included. If there are, please identify each item of information and discuss why you believe that such information should be included in the proposed consolidated audit trail. The Commission also requests comment on whether there are items of information included in the current SRO audit trails, and which are proposed to be included in the consolidated audit trail, that are unnecessary for surveillance, investigative or other regulatory purposes. If so, what are these data elements and why are they not necessary as part of a consolidated audit trail? Are they relevant for other purposes? The Commission further requests comment on whether it should require, as part of the disclosure of special handling instructions, the disclosure of an individual algorithm that may be used by a member or customer to originate or execute an order, and if so, how such an algorithm should be identified.</p>
              <p id="a782f275-b02d-41de-9c97-8328271917e3">As noted above, members currently are required to indicate whether an order would open or close a position for listed options.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-4" NAME="fr_pz74-4">203</a> The Commission requests comment as to what extent members currently obtain or have access to this information from their customers, or track this information for their own proprietary orders, for all NMS securities. If members currently do obtain this information, is the information collected and stored electronically? If members currently do not have access to or obtain this information for customer orders, what would be the impact of the proposed requirement to collect and provide this information to the central repository? What would be the costs, if any, of collecting and providing this information? Please explain and quantify any potential impact or costs.</p>
              <p id="45d1f160-af90-4c13-81b0-dba09b91ca2b">The proposed Rule does not specify exact order types (e.g., market, limit, stop, pegged, stop limit) to be included as material terms of an order because order types may differ across markets, and even an order type with the same title may have a different meaning from one exchange to another. Further, markets are frequently creating new order types and eliminating existing order types. In addition, the Commission notes that it may be difficult to distinguish between an &#8220;order type&#8221; and a special handling instruction, such as &#8220;do not display.&#8221; The Commission therefore preliminarily believes that it would not be practical to include in the proposed Rule a list of order types in the required information to be reported to the central repository. The Commission notes, however, that the SROs may choose to include more detail in the NMS plan. The Commission requests comment on this approach. The Commission also requests comment as to whether there are other items of information that would be required to be reported to the central repository that have, or may have, different meanings across different exchanges. If so, what are they? How should these differences be addressed in the proposed Rule?</p>
              <p id="9a67012d-e1e5-43e3-8977-8baca16b3bee">The proposed Rule also would require the NMS plan to require each member of an exchange or FINRA to &#8220;tag&#8221; each order received or originated by the member with a unique order identifier that would be reported to the central repository and that would stay with that order throughout its life, including routing, modification, execution, and cancellation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-4" NAME="fr_pz75-4">204</a> The members, exchanges, and FINRA would be required to pass along the unique order identifier with the order when routing the order, and the unique order identifier would be required on each reportable event report. For example, Member ABC that receives an order from a customer would immediately assign it a unique order identifier, and would report that identifier to the central repository along with the rest of the required information. If Member ABC subsequently routed the order to another member, Member DEF, Member ABC would be required to pass along to Member DEF the unique order identifier, as well as to attach the unique order identifier when reporting the routing of the order to the central repository. If Member DEF routed the order to Exchange A for execution, Member DEF would pass along to Exchange A with the order the unique order identifier, and would attach the identifier on the report of the route sent to the central repository. Exchange A would be required to attach the unique order identifier when reporting receipt of the order, and an execution of the order (if applicable) to the central repository.</p>
              <p id="3b8a0b08-7c95-4163-b13b-adb4733f0ad5">The Commission recognizes that the reality of how orders are routed and executed often is complex, and that it likely is not feasible to anticipate how the proposed requirement for a unique order identifier would or would not apply to each different factual scenario. For example, members may often execute customer orders on a &#8220;riskless principal&#8221; basis,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-2" NAME="fr_pz76-2">205</a> rather than on an agency basis. The Commission preliminarily believes that it would not be practical or feasible to "link" through related unique order identifiers the customer order(s) and the member's proprietary order(s) from which the customer order is given an allocation. Rather, the Commission envisions that the member would create a new unique order identifier for each proprietary order, and that the manner in which the execution of the customer order would be &#8220;linked&#8221; with one (or more) proprietary order(s) (if at all) would be through the inclusion of the unique order identifier for the contra-side order(s) on the report of the execution of the customer order sent to the central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-3" NAME="fr_pz76-3">206</a> However, in a situation where a member merely broke up a larger customer order into smaller orders and sent those orders, on an agency basis, to multiple markets for execution, the Commission preliminarily believes that the unique order identifier of the original customer order should carry through in some manner to the individual smaller orders that result when the original order is broken up. For example, it may be necessary to attach two unique order identifiers to an order &#8211; the original order identifier (i.e. parent order) and the individual smaller order identifier (i.e. child order). Alternatively, the unique order identifier of the parent order could be modified to carry through to the child orders (for example, the parent order could have an identifier ABC and the child orders could have identifiers of ABC1 and ABC2).</p>
              <p id="a25acdc1-b9c2-4e97-a0c7-71f16476373c">The Commission preliminarily believes that a unique order identifier that is essentially transferred along with an order from origination through execution or cancellation is useful for a consolidated audit trail. The use of such an identifier would allow the SROs and the Commission to efficiently link all events in the life of an order and help create a complete audit trail across markets and broker-dealers that handle the order. In this manner, being able to link the parent order with the child orders through the unique order identifiers would allow for ease of tracking of the original parent order throughout its life. While the Commission believes that a unique order identifier is an important data element for the consolidated audit trail, the Commission is not proposing at this time to mandate the format of such an identifier or how the identifier would be generated.</p>
              <p id="289eb34a-d6a8-4210-b18c-fc10a126712e">The Commission requests comment on whether, and why, a unique order identifier that would stay with the order for the life of the order is useful or essential for an effective consolidated audit trail. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether there is an alternative to a unique order identifier that would stay with the order for the life of the order. For example, would permitting each member or SRO that receives an order from another member or SRO to attach its own unique identifier to an order allow the SROs to efficiently link all events in the life an order and ensure the creation of a complete audit trail across each market and broker-dealer that handled the order? The Commission requests comment on the feasibility and merits of the manner in which it proposes unique order identifiers be handled for riskless principal transactions. The Commission also requests comment on the feasibility and merits of requiring that a unique order identifier be attached to an order, as well as the multiple orders that may result if the original order is subsequently broken up into several orders, in a manner that would permit regulators to trace the subsequent orders back to the original single order. The Commission also requests comment on the feasibility and merits of requiring that a unique order identifier be attached to an order that is the result of a combination of two more orders in a manner that would permit regulators to trace the combined order back to its component orders. The Commission further requests comment as to how unique order identifiers could be generated for both electronic and manual orders, and who should be responsible for generating them. Given the significant number of orders (including quotations) for which information would be required to be collected and provided to the central repository pursuant to the proposed Rule, the Commission requests comment on the feasibility of allowing unique order identifiers to be reused. If unique order identifiers were to be re-used, at what point should that be allowed? Are there any concerns with re-use that should be addressed? Additionally, the Commission requests comment on whether it is feasible to require unique order identifiers if the consolidated audit trail is implemented in the proposed phased approach? For example, is it appropriate to require that national securities exchanges and national securities associations comply with this requirement before their members are required to do so?</p>
              <p id="f1794786-f4c7-4db1-97a2-9cccdca4a414">The Commission also requests comment on procedures or safeguards market participants may wish to establish to ensure that unique order identifiers are routed and reported accurately. Further, the Commission requests comment on what systems modifications, if any, would be required in order to &#8220;tag&#8221; every order with a unique order identifier. Please respond to each question with specificity.</p>

              <p id="6fb7389b-bc26-4c0f-8b84-f28ef72654fb">The Commission preliminarily believes that the required execution information, in combination with the proposed information pertaining to order receipt or origination, modification, or cancellation, would provide regulators with a comprehensive, near real time view of all stages and all participants in the life of an order. The proposed Rule would allow the Commission and SROs to identify, for a particular transaction, every member and national securities exchange involved in the receipt or origination, routing, modification, and execution (or cancellation) of the order. This order information, including the readily accessible customer information, should help regulators investigate suspicious trading activity in a more timely manner than currently possible.</p>
              <p id="5072b800-3964-41df-8619-f2ea4816feeb">Additionally, the requirement to report whether and when the execution of the order was reported to the consolidated tape<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-3" NAME="fr_pz82-3">213</a> should allow regulators to more efficiently evaluate certain trading activity. For example, trading patterns of reported and unreported transactions may cause the staff of an SRO or the Commission to make further inquiry into the nature of the trading to determine whether the public was receiving accurate and timely information regarding executions and that market participants were continuing to comply with the trade reporting obligations under SRO rules. Similarly, patterns of reported and unreported transactions could be indicia of market abuse, including failure to obtain best execution for customer orders or possible market manipulation. Being able to more efficiently compare the consolidated order execution data with the trades reported to the consolidated tape could thus be an important component of overall surveillance activity.</p>
              <p id="a3344e4a-d38a-4532-8cc0-436e4caa6ecb">As discussed above, the Commission recognizes that the execution of orders often is complex.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-4" NAME="fr_pz82-4">214</a> For example, a customer order may be executed on a riskless principal basis. When a member receives a customer order, rather then sending the customer order as an agency order to an exchange or other marketplace for execution, the member creates an order for its proprietary account that it sends to an exchange or other marketplace to be executed. Once an execution occurs in the proprietary account, the member would then execute the customer order against its proprietary account. This process can be complicated by the member receiving and handling more than one customer order at a time, and creating one or more proprietary orders to send to one or more markets, and the manner in which the member allocates executions from its proprietary account among the customer orders. Each proprietary order would have a unique order identifier that is different from, and not linked to, the unique order identifier for the original customer order. How should the reporting to the central repository of the execution of the proprietary orders and the customer order be handled? As noted above, the Commission envisions that the manner in which the execution of the customer order would be &#8220;linked&#8221; with one (or more) of the proprietary order(s) would be through the inclusion of the unique order identifier for the contra-side order(s) on the report of the execution of the customer order sent to the central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-4" NAME="fr_pz83-4">215</a> Is this practical? Is there another method by which to link the execution of the customer order to the proprietary orders? Is it necessary to do so to achieve the purposes of the consolidated audit trail?</p>
              <p id="74c70c43-aa3a-4b20-a6e1-10049daa6ef8">The Commission requests comment on whether the information proposed to be collected and reported would be sufficient to create a complete and accurate audit trail. Is there additional information that should be collected and reported? If yes, please describe the information and the value its collection and reporting would add to the consolidated audit trail.</p>

The Commission preliminarily believes that it would be useful to know the account number as well as the required information on the beneficial owner. For example, a person or groups of persons could trade through a single account or numerous accounts. Because individual traders may use multiple accounts at multiple broker-dealers, being able to identify the beneficial owner of the underlying accounts aids in the identification and investigation of suspicious trading activity. Similarly, traders may seek to hide manipulative activity from regulatory oversight by trading anonymously through omnibus accounts. In those instances, linking the trade to the individual trader requires the market center to be able to identify both the accounts trading and the beneficial owner or owners of those accounts to determine what person or group of persons is directing the specific trades at issue. Requiring the identity of the ultimate customer electronically to be attached to each order would make this information easily accessible and searchable and thus would greatly improve the usefulness of audit trail information for purposes of effective enforcement and cross-market surveillance.</p>

While one of the objectives of the proposed Rule is to collect data on a real time basis, the Commission understands that certain information may not be available at the time of the reportable event (e.g., the execution or cancellation). The Commission, however, believes such information should be provided promptly after receipt, meaning as soon as possible given the capabilities of a market participant&#8217;s systems. While the Commission is proposing that the information be reported promptly, the proposed Rule also would provide an objective time limit for providing the information &#8211; no later than midnight on the day the event occurs or the information is received by the exchange, association, or member. Is the proposed time frame reasonable with respect to the information that would be required to be reported? Should the proposed Rule only require that information be reported promptly after receipt? How should promptly be measured? Alternatively, should the proposed Rule only require that information not available at the time the reportable event occurs be reported no later than midnight on the day the information was received?

To what extent do SROs and their members currently synchronize clocks? Please answer with specificity. Would synchronization as proposed require significant systems modifications on behalf of national securities exchanges, national securities association, or their respective members? Is it reasonable to require clocks to be synchronized with the time maintained by NIST within a time frame that is &#8220;consistent with industry standards&#8221;? Is there another standard that should be used by the Commission?

            <p id="838e47b1-1c10-4791-bb21-1ba0d85693c8">This requirement is intended to allow SRO and Commission staff to easily search across order, NBBO, and transaction databases. The Commission preliminarily believes that having the NBBO information in a format compatible with the order audit trail information would be useful for enforcing compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations. The NBBO is used by regulators to evaluate members for compliance with numerous regulatory requirements, such as the duty of best execution or <a href="">Rule 611 of Regulation NMS</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz91-4" NAME="fr_pz91-4">234</a> Regulators would be able to compare order execution information to the NBBO information on a more timely basis because the order and execution information would be available on a real time basis and all of the information would be available in a compatible format in the same database. The SROs also may enjoy economies of scale by adopting standard cross-market surveillance parameters for these types of violations. This information also would be available to the Commission to assist in its oversight efforts.</p>
            <p id="ea70a068-a1df-417f-9517-3bb3b6dc0147">The Commission also preliminarily believes that requiring the central repository to collect and retain in its database the transaction information in a format compatible with the order execution information would aid in monitoring for certain market manipulations. As discussed above, the proposed Rule would require that each report of the execution (in whole or in part) of an order sent to the central repository include a notation as to whether the execution was reported to the consolidated tape pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan or the OPRA Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-4" NAME="fr_pz92-4">235</a> This requirement should allow regulators to more efficiently evaluate certain trading activity. For example, trading patterns of reported and unreported trades may cause the staff of an SRO to make further inquiry into the nature of the trading to determine whether the public was receiving accurate and timely information regarding executions and that market participants were continuing to comply with the trade reporting obligations under SRO rules. Similarly, patterns of reported and unreported transactions could be indicia of market abuse, including failure to obtain best execution for customer orders or possible market manipulation. Being able to more efficiently compare the consolidated order execution data with the trades reported to the consolidated tape could thus be an important component of overall surveillance activity.</p>
            <p id="a3cb1109-48e0-4fe2-b048-054fe8b426ab">The Commission requests comment on the usefulness or necessity of requiring the central repository to collect and retain in a format compatible with the order audit trail information the NBBO and transaction report information to help achieve the stated objectives of the consolidated audit trail. Do commenters believe that it is important for achieving the purposes of the consolidated audit trail? If so, why? If not, why not? What are the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining transaction information separately from order and execution data included in the consolidated audit trail? Should the transaction information be included in the consolidated audit trail report? The Commission requests comment on whether the requirement that the transaction and NBBO information be maintained in a format compatible with the order information is practical. Would this requirement achieve the goal of helping SRO and Commission staff conducts searches and run surveillances across databases?</p>
            <p id="4ce3bca3-c331-488e-bc7a-a6069128ac8b">The Commission has recently required that issuers report certain data in interactive data format such as XBRL.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-4" NAME="fr_pz93-4">236</a> This proposal does not specify any particular or required data format, but allows the SROs to select a data format. Should the Commission require that the data be transmitted or stored in any particular format? What are the relative merits of flat data files, relational data files, and interactive data files? What other formats should be considered? In what format can the SROs and their members efficiently transmit data? In what format would the data required in the proposal be most easily accessed?</p>
            <p id="2a227aeb-6ba1-47e7-80eb-876469742870">The proposed Rule would require the NMS plan to require the central repository to retain the information collected pursuant to subparagraph (c)(7) and (e)(5) of the proposed Rule in a convenient and usable standard electronic data format that is directly available and searchable electronically without any manual intervention for a period of not less than five years. The information would be required to be available immediately, or if immediate availability could not reasonably and practically be achieved, any search query would be required to begin operating on the data not later than one hour after the search query is made.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-5" NAME="fr_pz93-5">237</a></p>
            <p id="701dec34-c2c6-40b6-90ac-b5244cc2772f">The Commission preliminarily believes that the information (or the results of a query searching the information) should generally be available immediately. However, the Commission recognizes that the results of an electronic search query may not be immediately available because, for instance, the system must check an extremely large number of records to answer the query or the system may need to retrieve records from electronically archived data. In the case of archived data, the Commission preliminarily proposes requiring that the search query would need to begin operating on the data not later than one hour after the query is made. The Commission requests comment as to whether one hour would be reasonable amount of time to allow for accessing archived data. Under current technological limitations, how long should it take to access, in an electronic query with no manual intervention, archived data of the type to be held by the central repository? The Commission also requests comment on whether it should mandate a time standard, such as one hour, in the proposed Rule. Further, the Commission requests comment on whether the central repository should be required to retain this information for longer or shorter than five years. The Commission also requests comment on the cost impact of these proposed record retention requirements. For example, could comparable functionality be obtained at lower cost with a different standard (for example, what would be the cost comparison for one hour versus two hours)?</p>

For example, should SROs or the central repository be allowed to make the data available to third parties, such as for academic research? If so, should the data be permitted to be sold to help offset costs? By SROs? By the central repository? If so, should there be set parameters? If the data were made available to third parties, what protections should be put in place to ensure the confidentiality of the data? Are there particular data elements that are more sensitive and should not be sold to help ensure the privacy of any individual and proprietary information? Are there particular data elements that would pose fewer concerns if released on a significant time lag? How long would such a time lag need to be? What other concerns might arise from the use of the data for non-regulatory purposes? Would use of the data provide certain market participants with undue information advantages over other market participants, increasing informational asymmetry in the markets? Would the provision of market data to third parties affect the willingness of market participants to trade in the U.S. markets? On the other hand, would enhanced surveillance of the markets as a result of the consolidated audit trail attract additional trading volume to the U.S. markets? What would be the implications, if any, under the financial privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-4" NAME="fr_pz97-4">243</a> The Commission also requests comment as to whether, and to what extent, other regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, should have access to the data? For instance, to what extent do commenters believe it would be beneficial for the Commission to work with other regulators to collectively share information each regulator has with respect to products and trading activity under its jurisdiction, to help the Commission and other regulators carry out their respective oversight of products and trading activity within their own jurisdiction?

Specifically, the policies and procedures would be required to be designed to help ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the data provided to the central repository by the SROs and their members. The Commission expects that these policies and procedures would include the creation of certain validation parameters that would need to be met before data would be accepted into the central repository.</p>

To what extent could SROs make effective use of the proposed consolidated information to enhance or update their existing surveillance and regulation? How would SROs be able to enhance or change their existing surveillance and regulation to make use of the proposed consolidated information?

Therefore, the Commission would consider full compliance by these entities with the NMS plan of the utmost importance. To this end, the proposed Rule would provide that each national securities exchange and national securities association shall comply with the provisions of the NMS plan of which it is a sponsor submitted pursuant to the proposed Rule and approved by the Commission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz103-7" NAME="fr_pz103-7">249</a> In addition, the proposed Rule would provide that any failure by a national securities exchange or national securities association to comply with the provisions of the NMS plan of which it is a sponsor could be considered a violation of the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz103-8" NAME="fr_pz103-8">250</a> For example, a failure to provide required information to the central repository, a failure to develop and implement a surveillance system or enhance existing surveillance systems reasonably designed to make use of the consolidated data in the central repository, or any limitation on the ability of an SRO or the Commission to access and use the data maintained by the central repository for regulatory purposes would violate the proposed Rule. The Commission recognizes that its staff, and the SRO staff, may have to undertake certain technical actions to access the data, such as arranging for a live feed, querying the system, or upgrading systems to be able to receive the data. The Commission preliminarily would not view having to take such technical actions, by themselves, as a limitation. The Commission notes that the proposed Rule would require the central repository to maintain the data in a convenient and usable standard electronic data format that is directly available and searchable electronically without any manual intervention for a period of not less than five years. The information would be required to be available immediately, or if immediate availability could not reasonably and practically be achieved, any search query would be required to begin operating on the data not later than one hour after the search query is made.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz104-3" NAME="fr_pz104-3">251</a> The Commission requests comment on whether other types of technical actions should not be viewed as an impermissible limitation on access.

          <p id="6f590df9-f359-43c6-b2f9-f9d0f11a28e5">The proposed Rule would require that the NMS plan include a governance structure to ensure fair representation of the plan sponsors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz108-3" NAME="fr_pz108-3">263</a> The rule as proposed gives flexibility to the SROs to devise a governance structure as they see fit. The proposed rule would require the NMS plan to include a provision addressing the percentage of votes required by the plan sponsors to effectuate amendments to the plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aamv" NAME="fr_Aamv">264</a> For example, the plan sponsors could determine to provide each plan sponsor one vote on matters subject to a vote.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz108-4" NAME="fr_pz108-4">265</a> Or, if there was a concern that this method would result in &#8220;blocs&#8221; of plan sponsors under common control exerting control in a one-sponsor, one-vote system, the SROs could choose another alternative to ensure fair representation.</p>
          <p id="0330f702-c483-4499-84fa-ab6911ba1f6f">Further, most existing NMS plans require unanimous consent from the plan sponsors to effect an amendment.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz108-5" NAME="fr_pz108-5">266</a> The Commission recognizes the unanimous consent requirement could be desirable because it helps to ensure that no plan sponsor is forced to comply with requirements with which it is unable to comply, or forced by the other sponsors to pay fees. However, a unanimous consent requirement also could allow one plan sponsor to effectively &#8220;veto&#8221; a provision desired by all other plan sponsors for competitive reasons, or permit one sponsor to lag behind in making updates to its systems or rules that would benefit the industry as a whole. The Commission proposes to allow the plan sponsors to determine whether to include in the NMS plan to be filed with the Commission a unanimity requirement for effectuating amendments to the plan, or some other convention.</p>
          <p id="270abd87-b5b3-413e-9051-f880813c09a7">The Commission also recognizes that the scope or purpose of the proposed NMS plan may differ from existing plans. The Commission requests comment on whether there are lessons from previous experience that suggest that the governance structure of the NMS plan to be filed with the Commission should differ from existing plans. The Commission requests comment on these provisions relating to the governance structure of the plan. Should the Commission require certain governance standards to ensure efficient cooperation, or should the exchanges and association be allowed to create a governance structure of their own choosing? What are the relative merits of unanimity or super majority requirements? What are the relative merits of alternative voting mechanisms and other governance structures available to the plan sponsors? Should the voting mechanism vary by the type of decision or should different decision making bodies have authority over different types of decisions to avoid situations where no decision is made because the sponsors cannot agree? How should the governance and voting mechanisms be set up to avoid inefficient operations or paralysis? Should there be limits on the time frames given to make decisions? Should there be mechanisms to resolve impasses once a decision has taken a certain amount of time? The Commission also requests comment on whether the scope of the plan, including the requirements on broker-dealers members, and the expectation of improved surveillances for investor protection dictate that the governance structure should differ from existing plans. In particular, should the SRO sponsors be required to include in the governance structure and decision-making authority representatives of members to address member interests and independent representatives chosen specifically to address investor and other public interests?</p>
          <p id="1d70ee16-2f78-40af-bc9b-3e464bb74acc">The proposed Rule also would require that the NMS plan include provisions to govern the administration of the central repository, including the selection of a plan processor. A &#8220;plan processor&#8221; is defined in <a href="">Rule 600 of Regulation NMS</a> to mean any SRO or securities information processor acting as an exclusive processor in connection with the development, implementation and/or operation of any facility contemplated by an effective national market system plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz110-4" NAME="fr_pz110-4">267</a> The Commission expects that the plan sponsors would engage in a thorough analysis and formal competitive bidding process to choose the plan processor. As proposed, the plan sponsors would be required to select a person to act as the plan processor for the central repository no later than two months after the effectiveness of the national market system plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz110-5" NAME="fr_pz110-5">268</a> The Commission preliminarily believes that this time frame would provide the plan sponsors with sufficient time to choose the plan processor, while providing that such entity would be in place with enough time to create and build the central repository to receive data from the SROs within one year after effectiveness of the NMS plan and from the members within two years after such effectiveness.</p>
          <p id="7ba0a422-a131-4bfd-9515-0a5f34aa4fbc">The Commission requests comment as to whether the proposed Rule should include specific requirements detailing the process for selection of a plan processor. Should the Commission require specific minimum requirements or standards that a plan processor should meet? If so, what requirement or standards would be necessary or appropriate? Should the plan processor be a non-SRO? Would this promote impartiality on the part of the plan processor? The Commission also requests comment on the proposed time frame to choose the plan processor. Is it too short? Too long? If so, why? Please be specific in your response.</p>
          <p id="436de1f5-c2c5-427d-a139-8e27423d7553">The proposed Rule also would require that the NMS plan contain a requirement that a Chief Compliance Officer (&#8220;CCO&#8221;) be appointed to regularly review the operation of the central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz111-5" NAME="fr_pz111-5">269</a> The CCO would be expected to establish reasonable procedures designed to make sure the operations of the central repository keep pace with technical developments. To the extent upgrades or other changes are necessary to assure the central repository&#8217;s effectiveness, the CCO would be responsible for making recommendations for enhancements to the nature of the information collected and the manner in which it is processed.</p>
          <p id="d5b04865-c35a-4b25-9119-69ec850f1b8c">The Commission requests comment on the necessity for a CCO to oversee the operation of the central repository. If commenters support the proposal to require a CCO, should the proposed Rule include a requirement that the CCO be independent from the plan sponsors and their members? That is, should the CCO be required to not have any actual or potential conflicts of interest with respect to the plan sponsors and their members (e.g. such as prior or future employment with a plan sponsor or member, or a material business relationship with a plan sponsor or member)? What are the risks of allowing a CCO who is affiliated or associated with a plan sponsor or its members? What types of conflicts of interest should be avoided? Are there any specific qualifications that a CCO should possess? Should there be a specific process in place for appointing a CCO or for removing a CCO for failure to perform his or her assigned duties? Should there be a limit to the number of years a CCO may serve as such?</p>
          <p id="6b7c40f8-5851-4050-8042-748312a71a5f">The plan sponsors also would be required to include in the NMS plan a provision addressing the requirements for the admission of new sponsors to the plan and the withdrawal of sponsors from the plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz112-3" NAME="fr_pz112-3">270</a> Proposed Rule 613(b)(4) also would require that the sponsors develop a process for allocating among the plan sponsors the costs associated with implementing and operating the central repository, including a provision addressing the manner in which such costs would be allocated to sponsors who join the plan after it was approved. Various NMS plans have developed different ways to ensure that a fair cost or &#8220;new participant fee&#8221; is assessed upon new plan sponsors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz112-4" NAME="fr_pz112-4">271</a> For example, when determining a new participation fee, the OPRA Plan requires that the following factors be considered: (1) the portion of costs previously paid by OPRA for the development, expansion and maintenance of OPRA&#8217;s facilities which, under generally accepted accounting principles, would have been treated as capital expenditures and would have been amortized over the five years preceding the admission of the new member; (2) an assessment of costs incurred and to be incurred by OPRA for modifying the OPRA System or any part thereof to accommodate the new member, which are not otherwise required to be paid or reimbursed by the new Member; and (3) previous fees paid by other new members. The plan sponsors could choose to include in the NMS plan to be filed a similar provision or develop a new method for determining the cost to join the plan that would better suit the NMS plan proposed to be required by this Rule.</p>
          <p id="adff0154-7d96-4be1-899c-3f653766b36a">The Commission requests comment on whether the rule or plan should specify a method for allocating costs among the plan sponsors. The Commission also requests comment as to what provisions the exchanges and FINRA should include in the NMS plan relating to the admission of new plan sponsors and the withdrawal of existing plan sponsors. Should the Commission specify the process for the admission of new plan sponsors? What are the concerns, if any, that should be taken into account when providing for the admission of new plan sponsors? The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed Rule relating to governance and administration of the NMS plan.</p>

Therefore, the proposed Rule would provide that the proposed data collection and submission requirements would first apply to national securities exchanges and national securities associations, but not to their individual members. As part of operating their businesses, the national securities exchanges and national securities associations are accustomed to handling large volumes of data and many already have in place electronic trading, routing and reporting systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz113-5" NAME="fr_pz113-5">272</a> Further, under the proposal the exchanges would not be responsible for providing to the central repository, for each order, information relating to the customer. The Commission therefore preliminarily believes these systems could more readily and quickly be modified than the members&#8217; systems to comply with the requirements of the proposed Rule.</p>
          <p id="22cd5bb7-c1c6-436e-9c25-41813ec67ed9">Specifically, proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)(3)(iii)</a> would require the exchanges and associations to provide to the central repository the data to be required by the Rule within one year after effectiveness of the NMS plan. Members of the exchanges and associations would be required to begin providing to the central repository the data required by the proposed Rule two years after effectiveness of the NMS plan, which would be one year following the implementation deadline for the national securities exchanges and national securities associations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz114-3" NAME="fr_pz114-3">273</a> This phased approach is designed to allow members additional time to implement systems changes necessary to begin providing the information to the central repository and to develop procedures designed to capture customer and order information that they may not have previously been required to collect to comply with other Commission and SRO rules.</p>
          <p id="9233b828-7e71-4b76-8714-a8242779fb8d">The Commission requests comment on the proposed implementation time periods. Are these time periods practical or feasible? Should they be shorter? Longer? Please provide detailed reasons in your response. As proposed, the national securities exchanges and national securities associations would be required to submit data to the central repository for one year before their members are required to submit data. Is requiring the exchanges and FINRA to provide data before requiring their members to do so a feasible way to phase in compliance with the proposed rule? How would this phased-in approach affect the quality of the data and the number of available data items in the audit trail? Are there alternative ways to phase in implementation that would be more practical? For instance, should the Commission consider requiring all exchanges and FINRA and their respective members to begin reporting a subset of the data initially, and phase in the collection of addition data over time? Should the Commission require all exchanges, FINRA, and their members to implement the proposed requirements first for NMS stocks, then for listed options? Or vice versa? How should the Commission take into consideration any concern commenters might have that market participants might shift manipulative or other illegal trading activity to products or markets not covered by the proposed Rule in its analysis of whether, or how, to phase in compliance with the proposed Rule across products classes (meaning, NMS stock and listed options)? If so, how?</p>

Would ATSs be able to more quickly comply with the proposed recording and reporting requirements, since they generally are highly automated and their business may be more narrowly focused than, for example, broker-dealers that engage in a customer, proprietary, and/or market making business? Are there any cost savings associated with a phased approach to implementation? Would additional unnecessary costs be incurred by implementing the plan in a phased-in approach?

              <p id="45a329a8-a469-4c3e-8c12-85e8d98d8deb">After the central repository systems have been developed and implemented, there would be ongoing costs for operating the central repository, including the cost of paying the CCO; the cost of systems and connectivity upgrades or changes necessary to receive, consolidate, and store the reported order and execution information from SROs and their members; the cost, including storage costs, of collecting and maintaining the NBBO and transaction data in a format compatible with the order and event information collected pursuant to the proposed Rule; the cost of monitoring the required validation parameters, which would allow the central repository to automatically check the accuracy and completeness of the data submitted and reject data not conforming to these parameters consistent with the requirements of the proposed Rule; and the cost of compensating the plan processor. The Commission preliminarily assumes that the plan processor would be responsible for the ongoing operations of the central repository. The Commission estimates that these costs would be approximately $100 million in external costs to the plan processor for operation of the central repository per year, or approximately $6,666,666 per plan sponsor per year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz133-4" NAME="fr_pz133-4">312</a></p>

            <p id="6ef0ef65-e566-4e1d-82ff-1b3aedb6e160">The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed Rule would require the collection and reporting in real time of much of the information that registered broker-dealers already maintain in compliance with existing regulations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz134-7" NAME="fr_pz134-7">317</a> For example, <a href="">Section 17 of the Exchange Act</a> and <a href="">Rule 17a-3</a> thereunder mandate that broker-dealers keep certain records of orders handled during the course of business.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz134-8" NAME="fr_pz134-8">318</a> Certain information also is required to be collected and reported by broker-dealers in compliance with a Commission request pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> under the Exchange Act.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz135-4" NAME="fr_pz135-4">319</a> The proposed Rule would, however, require SRO members to collect and report additional information for each order in a specified uniform format. In addition to the new information, the members also would be required to report most of the information on a real time basis to the central repository, which is not currently required. The Commission anticipates that SRO members would need to either enhance or replace their current order handling, trading, and other systems to be able to collect and report the required order and reportable event information to the central repository as required by the proposed Rule.</p>
            <p id="3f682fb4-fa3f-4e46-98f9-556da21fe7ee">The Commission recognizes that the extent to which a particular member would need to make systems changes or replace existing systems would differ depending upon the member&#8217;s current business operations and systems. The Commission preliminarily believes that members that rely mostly on their own internal order routing and execution management systems would need to make changes to or replace such systems to collect and report the required order and reportable event information to the central repository as required by the proposed Rule. The Commission estimates that there are approximately 1,114 of these types of members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz135-5" NAME="fr_pz135-5">320</a> The Commission preliminarily estimates the average initial one-time burden to develop and implement the needed systems changes to capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository in compliance with the proposed Rule for these members would be approximately 6,530 burden hours.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz136-3" NAME="fr_pz136-3">321</a> The Commission also preliminarily estimates that these members would, on average, incur approximately $1.5 million in one-time external costs for hardware and software to implement the systems changes needed to capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz136-4" NAME="fr_pz136-4">322</a> Therefore, the Commission preliminarily estimates that the average one-time initial burden per member would be 6,530 hours and $1.5 million, for an estimated aggregate burden of 7,274,420 hours and $1,671,000,000.</p>
            <p id="951680ef-12ab-491f-94f4-345e2429c4ce">This number would likely overestimate the costs for some of these members and underestimate it for others. For example, it may overestimate the cost for ATSs as opposed to members that engage in a customer and proprietary (or market marking) business, in part because of the narrower business focus of some ATSs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz136-6" NAME="fr_pz136-6">323</a> The Commission also recognizes that some or all of these members may contract with one or more outside vendors to provide certain front-end order management systems. The third-party vendor may make changes to its systems to permit the members that use the system to capture and provide the required information to the central repository. Likewise, some or all of these members may contract with outside vendors to provide back-office functionality. These third-party vendors may make changes to their systems to permit the members that use the systems to capture and provide the required information to the central repository. The cost of these changes may be shared by the various members that use the systems, and thus may result in a reduced cost to an individual member to implement changes to its own systems to comply with the requirements of the proposed Rule.</p>
            <p id="a8a11f04-9b14-4eda-9509-deeb5dd2a4be">Once such a member has established the appropriate systems and processes required for collection and transmission of the required information to the central repository, the Commission estimates that the proposal would impose on each member ongoing annual burdens associated with, among other things, personnel time to monitor each member&#8217;s reporting of the required data and the maintenance of the systems to report the required data; activity related to adding extra systems capacity to accommodate new order types that would need to be reported to the central repository; or implementing changes to trading systems which might result in additional reports to the central repository. The Commission preliminarily estimates that, on average, it would take a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association approximately 3,050 burden hours per year continued compliance with the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz137-3" NAME="fr_pz137-3">324</a> The Commission also estimates that it would cost, on average, approximately $756,000 per year per member to maintain the systems connectivity to the central repository and purchase any necessary hardware, software, and other materials.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-3" NAME="fr_pz138-3">325</a> Therefore, the Commission preliminarily estimates that the average ongoing annual burden per member would be approximately 3,050 hours, plus $756,000 external costs to maintain the systems necessary to collect and transmit information to the central repository, for an estimated aggregate annual burden of 3,397,700 hours and $842,184,000.</p>
            <p id="105ba64f-acf0-41d8-aaa2-5bac4c5bd303">The Commission preliminarily believes that other members generally would rely on functionality provided by third parties to electronically capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository in real time. For purposes of the proposed Rule, the Commission assumes that these members, which could include broker-dealers defined as &#8220;small entities&#8221; for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-4" NAME="fr_pz138-4">326</a> generally do not clear transactions and may not possess their own internal order routing and execution management systems, but instead rely on third-party providers for such functionality. Further, the Commission assumes that many of these members currently do not themselves report order or trade information and instead rely on their clearing firms or other third parties to do it for them. These smaller members may look for &#8220;turn key&#8221; systems that could provide the functionality required by the proposed Rule. As such, the Commission preliminarily believes that these members would not undertake a fundamental restructuring of their business to comply with the proposed Rule. Instead, they might continue to rely on their clearing broker-dealer, or they might purchase a standardized software product provided by a third party that would provide the functionality to electronically capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository in real time. The Commission estimates that there are approximately 3,006 of these types of members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-3" NAME="fr_pz139-3">327</a> For these members, Commission staff preliminarily estimates the average external cost to compensate a third party, whether the clearing broker-dealer or other third party, for software that would provide the necessary functionality to electronically capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository, would be approximately $50,000 per member.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-4" NAME="fr_pz139-4">328</a> In addition, the Commission preliminarily estimates that each of these members, on average, would incur a one-time burden of 140 hours to incorporate this functionality.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-5" NAME="fr_pz139-5">329</a> Therefore, the Commission preliminarily estimates an initial aggregate burden of 420,840 hours and $150,300,000.</p>
            <p id="c4b8d724-c223-4ae8-903f-577adc173a9d">Once such a member has procured the appropriate third party system(s) for collection and transmission of the required information to the central repository, the Commission preliminarily estimates that such a member would continue to incur, on average, an external cost of $50,000 annually to compensate a third party, whether the clearing broker-dealer or for software that would provide the necessary functionality to capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository. The Commission also preliminarily estimates that each such member would incur a cost for compliance personnel necessary to oversee continued compliance with the proposed Rule, which would result in 64 burden hours annually for such member.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-3" NAME="fr_pz140-3">330</a> Therefore, the Commission preliminarily estimates an aggregate ongoing burden of 192,384 hours and $150,300,000 to ensure compliance with the proposed Rule.</p>
            <p id="634c9e68-6043-4e62-94d9-61d0f4d33f6f">The Commission requests specific comments on each of its estimates with respect to the estimated burden and costs on members to comply with the proposed Rule. In particular, the Commission requests comment on the specific types and amount of costs, as well as internal staff burden, that would be incurred to modify members&#8217; order handling, trading, and other systems to comply with the proposed Rule. The Commission requests comment whether, and if so how, the estimated costs would be impacted if the members did not have to provide the information in proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(c)(7)(vi) and (vii)</a> (the non-real time information).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-4" NAME="fr_pz140-4">331</a> For instance, would requiring the reporting to the central repository of the account numbers for any subaccounts to which an execution is allocated, and the amount of a commission, if any, paid by the customer and the unique identifier of the broker-dealer(s) to whom the commission is paid, require changes to systems other than order handling and execution systems?</p>

Likewise, the Commission believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would significantly aid the Commission in its ability to oversee the exchanges and associations, and to enforce compliance by the members of exchanges and associations with the respective exchange&#8217;s or association&#8217;s rules, and the federal securities laws and regulations. The proposed consolidated audit trail also would aid the Commission in its efforts to limit the manipulation of security prices, and to limit the use of manipulative or deceptive devices in the purchase or sale of a security. Further, the proposal would benefit exchanges, FINRA, and Commission staff by improving the ability of exchanges, FINRA and Commission staff to conduct more timely and accurate trading analysis for market reconstructions, complex enforcement inquiries or investigations, as well as inspections and examinations.</p>
          <p id="47585e78-3e5a-4983-91c9-93a22e81664f">Specifically, the Commission preliminarily believes that, as proposed, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would enable exchanges and FINRA to more effectively and efficiently detect, investigate, and deter illegal trading activity, particularly cross-market illegal activity, in furtherance of their statutory obligations. In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would enhance the ability of the Commission staff in its regulatory and market analysis efforts. The proposed rule would achieve these objectives in several ways. First, proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would require the central repository to collect the same data on customer and order event information from each exchange, FINRA, and all members of the exchanges and FINRA, in a uniform format. Currently, the scope and format of audit trail information relating to orders and executions differs, sometimes significantly, among exchanges and FINRA. Thus, by requiring that all exchanges, FINRA and their members submit uniform customer and order event data to the central repository in a uniform format that would more readily allow for consolidation, the proposed Rule would allow regulators to more easily, and in a more timely manner, surveil potential manipulative activity across markets and market participants. The Commission preliminarily believes that this increased efficiency would enhance the ability of SRO and Commission staff to detect and investigate manipulative activity in a more timely manner, whether the activity is occurring on one market or across markets (or across different product classes). Timely pursuit of potential violations can be important in, among other things, seeking to freeze and recover any profits received from illegal activity.</p>
          <p id="bc8545e4-bf50-4096-8248-45292c14ecf5">The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would enhance the ability of SRO and Commission staff to regulate the trading of NMS securities by requiring that key pieces of information currently not captured in existing audit trails be reported to the proposed consolidated audit trail. For example, proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would require that the customer that submits or originates an order be identified in the consolidated audit trail. In addition, the proposed Rule would require the assignment of unique identifiers for each order, each customer, and each broker-dealer and SRO that handles an order. Further, the proposed Rule would greatly enhance the ability to track an order from the time of order inception through routing, modification, cancellation, and execution. The Commission preliminarily believes that this information would allow regulators to more easily track potential manipulative activity across markets and market participants, and would place SRO and Commission staff in a better position to surveil whether exchange rules, as well as federal securities laws, rules and regulations, are complied with.</p>
          <p id="784a4366-fcdf-45d5-be81-1f6b686a7643">The proposal also would require that most of the required audit trail information be submitted on a real time basis. Most existing audit trails currently collect information on orders at the end of the day, or upon request, rather than in real time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz145-3" NAME="fr_pz145-3">336</a> Other order and execution information, such as EBS data and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> data, is provided to the Commission only upon request. The proposed consolidated audit trail would require that certain information about orders and executions be provided on a real time basis. The Commission preliminarily believes that this requirement could significantly increase the ability of SRO and Commission staff to identify and investigate manipulative activity in a more timely manner.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz145-4" NAME="fr_pz145-4">337</a></p>
          <p id="e1dbfaf9-bd06-4205-801b-6a02c9345574">The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposal also would benefit exchanges, FINRA, and Commission staff by improving the ability of exchanges, FINRA and Commission staff to conduct timely and accurate trading analysis for market reconstructions, complex enforcement inquiries or investigations, as well as inspections and examinations. Today, trading activity is widely dispersed among various market centers, and one or more related orders for one or more securities or other related products may be routed to multiple broker-dealers and more than one exchange, or be executed in the OTC market. Thus, SRO and Commission regulatory staff investigating potentially illegal behavior may have to collect information from multiple broker-dealers and then examine, analyze and reconcile the disparate information provided in widely divergent formats to accurately reconstruct all trading activity during a particular time frame in the course of investigating potentially manipulative activity. Obtaining the necessary order and execution information and undergoing the necessary analysis to determine whether any wrongdoing exists based on the information available today requires substantial investment of time and effort on behalf of regulatory authorities. Under proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, regulatory authorities would be able to access all information about events in the life of an order or related orders, and obtain critical information identifying the customer (or beneficial owner) behind the order(s) directly from the central repository in a uniform format. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes that ability of SRO and Commission staff to conduct timely and accurate trading analysis for market reconstructions, complex enforcement inquiries and investigation, as well as inspections and examinations, would be significantly improved.</p>
          <p id="e910384f-0111-4c1e-8c71-24f889cf7059">The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposal would benefit SROs, as well as the NMS for NMS securities, by ultimately reducing some regulatory costs, which may result in a more effective re-allocation of overall costs. For example, by providing a more comprehensive and searchable database, the Commission preliminarily believes that the consolidated audit trail would significantly decrease the amount of time invested by SRO staff to determine whether any illegal activity is occurring either on one market or across markets. Currently, SRO regulatory staff may need to submit multiple requests to its members during the course of an investigation into possible illegal activity, or submit multiple requests to ISG to obtain audit trail information from other SROs about trading in a particular security, and then commit significant staff time to collating and analyzing the data produced. The proposal would benefit the Commission in similar respects. For example, Commission staff often must submit numerous requests to members after the Commission receives information from equity cleared reports in an attempt to identify the ultimate customer (or beneficial account holder) that entered the order or orders in question. Substantial Commission staff resources currently are invested in analyzing the data that is received in response to these requests.</p>
          <p id="1671e318-e8d3-4c8d-bece-3a470745ef0d">Under proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, SRO regulatory staff would have immediate, easily searchable access to the consolidated audit trail data through the central repository for purposes of conducting surveillance, investigations, and enforcement activities. Commission staff likewise would have more efficient and timely access for purposes of conducting risk assessments of referrals received, investigations, and enforcement activities, and for purposes of conducting market reconstructions or other analysis. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposal would benefit SRO and Commission staff, as well as the market for NMS securities as whole, by providing immediately accessible audit trail information to regulatory staff, which would in turn reduce staff time and effort that would otherwise be needed to collect and analyze audit trail information and allow such staff time and effort to be redirected to more effective uses, possibly even allowing the staff to engage in more investigations. In other words, if the costs per investigation decreased because of efficiencies in the proposed consolidated audit trail information, SRO or Commission staff may be able to review and investigate a greater amount of suspicious activity.</p>
          <p id="9f1e691f-2b02-49cf-84a8-d802e93cb0a5">Likewise, the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would benefit the exchanges, FINRA, the Commission, and the members of SROs, as well as investors and the public interest, by reallocating the overall cost of regulating the markets for NMS securities on an ongoing basis toward more efficient regulation. For instance, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would eliminate the need for certain SRO and Commission rules that currently mandate the collection and provision of information, at least with respect to NMS securities. As noted above, many exchanges and FINRA each have their own disparate audit trail rules. Thus, a member of the various exchanges and FINRA could be subject to the audit trail rules of, and be required to submit different information to, more than one exchange and FINRA. The Commission intends that the proposed consolidated audit trail replace the need to have disparate SRO audit trail rules. If proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> were adopted, and the consolidated audit trail was implemented, the Commission preliminarily believes that the exchanges and FINRA would not need to have separate and disparate audit trail rules that apply to NMS securities applicable to their members. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would ultimately result in the ability of SROs to repeal their existing audit trail rules because SRO audit trail requirements would be encompassed within proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. Similarly, the proposed consolidated audit trail also may render duplicative and thus unnecessary certain data obtained from the EBS system pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> (and the SRO rules implementing the EBS system), and from the equity cleared data, at least as it relates to NMS securities. SRO and Commission staff instead would be able to access the audit trail information for every order directly from the central repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz148-3" NAME="fr_pz148-3">338</a></p>
          <p id="9a0939f7-7353-46bc-acc3-0edfe5c48f66">The Commission requests comment on any ongoing cost savings to SROs or their members that could be achieved by the proposal. Are there any other systems or technologies that could be replaced by the proposed audit trail? Would additional Commission action be required to achieve cost savings due to redundant rules or systems? Are there any new systems or technology requirements that could offset these potential cost savings? To what extent would any cost savings amount to a reallocation of resources towards more effective or efficient uses? Please provide specific examples. The Commission also requests comment as to whether the proposed Rule should require the NMS plan to include provisions relating to transition from the existing audit trails to the proposed consolidated audit trail.</p>
          <p id="5501ac2c-a81b-4ad6-a220-b64e6ac1aa91">As discussed above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposal would significantly enhance the ability of SRO staff to efficiently and effectively regulate their market and their members, including detecting and investigating potential manipulative activity. The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would benefit the Commission in its regulatory and market analysis efforts. More timely detection and investigation of potential manipulative activity may lead to greater deterrence of future illegal activity if potential wrongdoers perceive a greater chance of regulators identifying their activity in a more timely fashion. To the extent investors consider the improvement in regulators&#8217; ability to detect and investigate wrongdoing as significant to their investment decisions, investor trust, which is a component of investor confidence, is improved and investors may be more willing to invest in the securities markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz149-3" NAME="fr_pz149-3">339</a> An increase in investor participation in the securities markets, at least to the extent that the increase is allocated efficiently, can potentially benefit the securities markets as a whole, through better capital formation. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would benefit the NMS for NMS securities by encouraging more efficient and potentially a higher level of capital investment.</p>
          <p id="68589e11-7d79-4599-96f5-df141bb24d98">The Commission requests comment on how the proposal would impact investor protections and investor confidence. In particular, would the consolidated audit trail better align investor protections to the expectations that investors have about their protections? What would be the economic effect of the potential changes to investor protections or to better alignment of those protections with investor expectations? Would any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed Rule be mitigated if market participants alter their trading behavior, such as by shifting their trading activity to products or markets that do not require the capture of customer information to avoid compliance with the requirements of the proposed Rule? If so, please explain how so, and what, if any, steps the Commission should take in response.</p>
          <p id="21754711-d307-441d-9855-a0d113cbeabc">The Commission also preliminarily believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would enhance the overall reliability of audit trail data that is available to the Commission and SRO regulatory staff. Because the proposed Rule would require that the NMS plan include policies and procedures, including standards, to be used by the plan processor to ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the audit data submitted to the central repository, there would be an automatic check on the incoming audit trail data submitted by exchanges and FINRA, and their members, for reliability and accuracy. The Commission expects that these policies and procedures would include validation parameters that would need to be met before audit trail data would be accepted into the central repository, and that the central repository would reject data that did not meet certain validation parameters, and require resubmission of corrected data. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes that the integrity of audit trail information available to the Commission and to the regulatory staff of the exchanges and FINRA would be enhanced and safeguarded by the provisions applicable to the central repository pursuant to proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>.</p>

Based on discussions with SROs, the Commission anticipates that exchanges would need to enhance or replace their current systems to be able to comply with the proposed information collection and reporting requirements of the proposed Rule.</p>
            <p id="6323ae4c-5879-496a-a385-85177810c527">Likewise, the Commission preliminarily believes the proposed Rule would require the collection of much of the information that registered broker-dealers already maintain in compliance with existing regulations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-5" NAME="fr_pz155-5">351</a> The proposed Rule, however, would require members to collect additional information for each order and, in addition to the new information, the members also would be required to report most of the information on a real time basis to the central repository in a specified uniform format. Based on discussions with members, the Commission anticipates that the SRO members would need to enhance or replace their current order handling, trading and other systems to be able to collect and report the required order and reportable event information to the central repository as required by the proposed Rule.</p>
            <p id="75d91894-56f6-4a5f-a237-6d59fe4f0cd5">The Commission recognizes that the extent to which a particular SRO or member would need to make systems changes would differ depending upon the SRO's market structure (e.g., floor vs. electronic) and systems, or the member&#8217;s current business operations and systems. The Commission preliminarily estimates that the average one-time, initial cost to exchanges and FINRA to put in place the systems necessary to identify, collect and transmit the consolidated audit trail information to the central repository would total approximately $5 million per SRO,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-3" NAME="fr_pz156-3">352</a> for an aggregate estimated cost of $75 million for all SROs. In estimating this cost, the Commission has considered SRO staff time necessary to build new systems or enhance existing systems to comply with the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-4" NAME="fr_pz156-4">353</a> In addition, the Commission estimated costs for system hardware, software, and other materials.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-5" NAME="fr_pz156-5">354</a> What other types of costs might SROs incur? Please be specific in your response.</p>
            <p id="04ee4325-c950-4b80-a634-6be7a706954d">Once an SRO has implemented the changes necessary to collect and transmit the required information to the central repository as required by the proposed Rule, the Commission estimates that each SRO would incur, on average, an annual ongoing cost of $2.5 million to ensure compliance with the proposed Rule,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-6" NAME="fr_pz156-6">355</a> for an estimated ongoing annual aggregate cost of $37.5 million for all SROs.</p>
            <p id="68a1c341-44b9-4628-a4c8-433fe09f16e3">The Commission understands that many members, particularly smaller members, currently rely on third parties to report information required to be reported pursuant to SRO audit trail or other rules. For example, a member that is an introducing broker who sends all of its customer order flow to a clearing broker currently may rely on that clearing broker for reporting purposes. The Commission preliminarily believes that these members would not undertake a fundamental restructuring of their business to comply with the proposed Rule. Instead, they might continue to rely on their clearing broker-dealer, or they might look for the ability to purchase a standardized software product provided by a third party that would provide the functionality to electronically capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository in real time. The costs of this approach are likely to be significantly lower than the costs to a member that enhances its own systems, or creates new systems, to comply with the proposed requirements to report information to the central repository. The Commission estimates that there are approximately 3,006 of these types of members, and that the average cost to such members to compensate a third party, whether a clearing broker-dealer or other third party, for software that would provide the necessary functionality to electronically capture the required information and transmit it to the central repository would be approximately $50,000 per member.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-3" NAME="fr_pz157-3">356</a> In addition, the Commission estimates that, on average, each member would incur a one-time cost of $35,870 to incorporate the new functionality into its existing systems to ensure compliance with the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz158-5" NAME="fr_pz158-5">357</a> Thus, the Commission preliminarily estimates that each of these members would incur, on average, a one-time cost of $85,870, for an estimated aggregate cost of $258,125,220.</p>
            <p id="dac386fc-78f8-445c-8e71-3e824c2d6d94">The Commission also preliminarily estimates that each of these members would continue to incur, on average, annual costs of $66,512 to ensure continued compliance with the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz158-7" NAME="fr_pz158-7">358</a></p>
            <p id="f9a0daa1-8405-46f5-964f-5f93dc09b9c1">Do commenters believe that smaller members would likely rely on third parties to provide a functionality that would provide required data to the central repository? Why or why not? Would it be more cost effective for a small member to enhance existing systems or create new systems to comply with the proposed Rule? Why or why not? What would be the costs associated with each approach? Should members that currently rely on another party to report, such as their clearing broker, be able to have their clearing firms report on their behalf? Why or why not? How would allowing third-party reporting impact the ability to report data in real time? Would the manner in which these members currently maintain customer information create practical difficulties for providing the beneficial ownership information, or additional burdens that have not been taken into account in estimating costs? For example, is customer information stored electronically? What is the impact of the manner in which this information is currently stored on the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates?</p>
            <p id="1a370abe-f1a5-43ac-9504-62d2616ff727">The Commission preliminarily estimates that there are 1,114 members that would undertake their own development changes to implement the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-3" NAME="fr_pz159-3">359</a> The Commission preliminarily estimates that the average one-time, initial cost to these members for development, including programming and testing of the systems necessary to identify, collect and transmit the consolidated audit trail information to the central repository, would be approximately $3 million per member,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-4" NAME="fr_pz159-4">360</a> for an estimated aggregate cost of $3,342,000,000. This number would likely overestimate the costs for some of these members and underestimate it for others. For example, it likely overestimates the cost for ATSs as opposed to broker-dealers that have a customer and proprietary, or market-making, business, in part because of the narrower business focus of some ATSs. The Commission recognizes that some of these members may contract with one or more outside vendors to provide certain front-end order management systems. The third-party vendor may make changes to its systems to permit the members that use the system to capture and provide the required information to the central repository. Likewise, some of these members may contract with outside vendors to provide back-office functionality. These third-party vendors may make changes to their systems to permit the members that use the systems to capture and provide the required information to the central repository. The cost of these changes may be shared by the various members that use the systems, and thus may result in a reduced cost to an individual member to implement changes to its own systems to comply with the requirements of the proposed consolidated audit trail.</p>
            <p id="dad60243-2e30-4c3a-8d2e-de24c74a6fb2">The Commission requests comment on this estimate. Specifically, what types of costs would members incur building new systems, or enhancing existing systems, to comply with the proposed Rule? Would members need to expand their capacity as part of any systems upgrades? What would be the costs associated with this? Would the manner in which these members currently maintain customer information create practical difficulties for providing the beneficial ownership information, or additional burdens that have not been taken into account in estimating costs? For example, is customer information stored electronically? What is the impact of the manner in which this information is currently stored on the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates?</p>
            <p id="5f8d317a-c945-4f57-954b-50cfddc1e1a4">Once these members have largely implemented the changes necessary to collect and report the required order and reportable event information to the central repository as required by the proposed Rule, the Commission estimates that each such member would incur, on average, an annual ongoing cost of approximately $1.5 million,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz160-4" NAME="fr_pz160-4">361</a> for an estimated aggregate ongoing cost of $ 1,671,000,000.

What types of costs would be included? Are there differences in the costs that SROs and their members would incur? Why or why not.</p>
            <p id="68f6fdc0-64ca-400c-a551-2c2e57377ff5">The proposal would require the transmission of information in real time to the central repository. The Commission preliminarily believes that this approach would have greater benefits and would be lower cost than an alternative of transmitting all reports in batch mode. Real time submission could simply require a "drop copy" of a reportable event be sent to the central repository at the same time that the reportable event is otherwise occurring. Batching, however, would require the build up of reports to be sent periodically, and the amount of data sent in a batch could be significantly larger than the data sent in real time. The Commission requests comment on the technology requirements and other costs of real time transmission of information versus periodically batching the reports. Would real time reporting be more or less costly than batch reporting? Please explain with specificity why or why not and provide cost estimates. If real time reporting would be more expensive, are the greater costs justified by the benefits of real time reporting described above? If batch reporting is the better alternative, what should be the frequency of the batch reporting and why? Does the answer depend on the type of security? The Commission also requests comment on what types of systems changes SROs and members would need to make to implement the proposed Rule and NMS plan requirements, and the attendant costs. What specific types or items of information, if any, would be required to be reported to the central repository by a member that would not already be collected and maintained in an automated format?</p>

Thus, information about "live" orders, as well as overall order and execution information for a particular customer, would be available in the central repository. In recognition of the sensitivity of this data, the proposed Rule requires the NMS Plan to include policies and procedures, including standards, to be used by the plan processor to ensure the security and confidentiality of all information submitted to, and maintained by, the central repository.</p>

Specifically, the proposed Rule requires that the policies and procedures be designed to ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the data provided to the central repository by the exchanges, FINRA and their members, and to require the rejection of data provided if the data does not meet validation parameters, and the retransmission of such data. The Commission notes that, despite such safeguards for ensuring the integrity of the audit trail data, the information submitted by the exchanges, FINRA and their members could be inaccurate, either due to system or human error. If the reliability of the data is compromised, this could reduce the usefulness of the consolidated audit trail data for regulatory purposes.</p>

The Commission begins its consideration of potential competitive impacts with observations of the current structure of the markets for trading NMS securities.</p>
          <p id="ee226421-bad2-48d0-9d7e-7f33c807ef49">The industry for the trading of NMS securities is a competitive one, with reasonably low barriers to entry and significant competition for order flow. The intensity of competition across trading platforms that trade NMS securities has increased dramatically in the past decade as a result of technological advances and regulatory changes. This increase in competition has resulted in decreases in market concentration, more competition among market centers, a proliferation of trading platforms competing for order flow, and decreases in trading fees.</p>
          <p id="be917fc1-d07f-4ad0-9331-76061e8644b4">In addition, the Commission, within the past five years, has approved applications by BATS,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-7" NAME="fr_pz174-7">390</a> Direct Edge,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-8" NAME="fr_pz174-8">391</a> Nasdaq,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-3" NAME="fr_pz175-3">392</a> and C2<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-4" NAME="fr_pz175-4">393</a> to become registered as national securities exchanges for trading equities, approved proposed rule changes by two existing exchanges &#8211; the ISE<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-5" NAME="fr_pz175-5">394</a> and CBOE<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-6" NAME="fr_pz175-6">395</a> - to add cash equity trading facilities to their existing options business; and approved proposed rule changes by two existing exchanges &#8211; Nasdaq and BATS &#8211; to add options trading facilities to their existing cash equities business.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-7" NAME="fr_pz175-7">396</a></p>
          <p id="10ee6179-9285-41d0-beec-338e624ee72f">The Commission believes that competition among trading venues for NMS stocks has been facilitated by several Commission rules: <a href="">Rule 611</a> (the Order Protection Rule), which encourages quote-based competition between market centers; <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f40a82e67368f6d9455b091353876043&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1605">Rule 605</a>, which empowers investors and brokers to compare execution quality statistics across trading venues; and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f40a82e67368f6d9455b091353876043&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1606">Rule 606</a>, which enables customers to monitor the order routing practices. Similarly, there is rigorous competition among the options exchanges that has been facilitated by regulatory efforts. These include the move to multiple listing,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-8" NAME="fr_pz175-8">397</a> the extension of the Commission&#8217;s Quote Rule to options,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-9" NAME="fr_pz175-9">398</a> the prohibition against trading outside of the national best bid and offer,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz176-3" NAME="fr_pz176-3">399</a> the adoption of market structures on the floor-based exchanges that permit individual market maker quotations to be reflected in the exchange&#8217;s quotation,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz176-4" NAME="fr_pz176-4">400</a> and the Minimum Quoting Increment Pilot Program.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz176-5" NAME="fr_pz176-5">401</a></p>
          <p id="34b3f2e8-4b44-46f2-bf74-4dd136207315">The broker-dealer industry also is a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry. Most trading activity is concentrated among several dozen large participants, with thousands of small participants competing for niche or regional segments of the market. The reasonably low barriers to entry for broker-dealers are evidenced, for example, by the fact that the average number of new broker-dealers entering the market each year between 2001 and 2008 was 389.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz176-18" NAME="fr_pz176-18">402</a></p>
          <p id="ba8880ff-2bec-4052-b8fa-c9c32b744bec">There are approximately 5,178 registered broker-dealers, of which approximately 890 are small broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz177-4" NAME="fr_pz177-4">403</a> To limit costs and make business more viable, the small participants often contract with bigger participants to handle certain functions, such as clearing and execution, or to update their technology. Larger broker-dealers often enjoy economies of scale over smaller broker-dealers and compete with each other to service the smaller broker-dealers, who are both their competitors and customers.</p>
          <p id="449836d6-c2ed-42e1-91d2-2a9da202d578">In the Commission&#8217;s preliminary judgment, the costs of proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. In industries characterized by easy entry and intense competition, the viability of some of the competitors may be sensitive to regulatory costs. Nonetheless, the Commission preliminarily believes that the overall marketplace for NMS securities would remain highly competitive, despite the costs associated with implementing proposed new <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, even if those costs influence the entry or exit decisions of some individual broker-dealer firms.</p>
          <p id="ea22ae32-30c7-44f3-9bd7-0908d814618d">As discussed above in <a href="#6fc608ca-d936-4c3a-920d-419038649d81">Sections V</a> and <a href="#36bd9d64-22db-42d5-81b9-c4d574c3ebc8">VI</a>, the Commission acknowledges that the proposal would entail significant costs of implementation. In particular, requiring national securities exchanges, national securities associations, and their members to capture the required information and provide it to the central repository in a uniform format, in particular information that is not currently captured under the existing audit trail or other regulatory requirements, would likely require significant one-time initial expenses to enhance or modify existing order handling, trading, and other systems. In addition, national securities exchanges and national securities associations would need to enhance or create new surveillance procedures to use the consolidated audit trail information. Preliminarily, the Commission does not believe that these implementation expenses would impose an undue burden on competition among SROs or among other market participants. The Commission preliminarily believes that the requirements associated with the proposed Rule are necessary and appropriate, and would apply uniformly to all national securities exchanges, national securities associations and their members, and thus would not result in an undue burden on competition.</p>
          <p id="1ca087ad-47e1-4c05-b545-eabe34326a41">As discussed above in <a href="#acc511e4-ef96-4160-be31-98919a668715">Section II</a>, the approach of proposed new <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would advance the purposes of the Exchange Act in a number of significant ways. The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> should aid each of the exchanges and FINRA in carrying out its statutory obligation to be organized and have the capacity to comply, and enforce compliance by its members, with its rules, and with the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations. Likewise, the Commission believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> should aid the Commission in fulfilling its statutory obligation to oversee the exchanges and associations, and to enforce compliance by the members of exchanges and associations with the respective exchange&#8217;s or association&#8217;s rules, and the federal securities laws and regulations. The proposed consolidated audit trail also would aid the Commission in its efforts to limit the manipulation of security prices, and to limit the use of manipulative or deceptive devices in the purchase or sale of a security. By potentially decreasing the opportunities for illegal activity and market manipulation, the proposed Rule should promote fair competition among market participants on the basis of effective regulation. Further, by imposing uniform audit trail requirements on all SROs and their members, and thus removing any incentive to compete based on regulation (or lack thereof), Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed Rule would allow SROs and their members to more effectively compete on other terms such as the services provided, price, and available liquidity.</p>
          <p id="ff2dbfa3-f2a8-463d-a535-85212ef79f8d">Based on the analysis above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposal would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. However, we seek comment on the impact of the proposed Rule on competition. The Commission requests comment on what, if any, would be the impact of the proposed Rule on competition among the exchanges and other non-exchange market centers? If commenters believe there would be an impact on competition, please explain and quantify the costs or benefits of such impact. For example, as noted above, exchanges would have access through the central repository to trading information about their competitors&#8217; customers. Do commenters believe that access to this information would have an impact on competition among exchanges? If so, please explain what the potential impact could be, and whether you believe that such impact would be an adverse. If so, please further address what, if any, steps the Commission should take in the proposed Rule to address such concerns.</p>

For example, the proposed consolidated audit trail would ensure that all orders are tracked from origination to execution or cancellation. Further, the consolidated audit trail would provide information on any modifications or routing decisions made with regard to an order. The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed audit trail information would greatly enhance the ability of its staff to effectively monitor and surveil the securities markets. This enhanced ability of the SROs and Commission staff to enforce the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations should help ensure that market participants that engage in fraudulent or manipulative activities are identified more swiftly, which should deter future attempts to do the same. In general, the faster fraudulent or manipulative activity is identified and action is taken, the more likely ill-gotten gains will remain available to pay penalties or compensate victims.</p>
          <p id="831dc4a8-e5b5-4a34-b9dc-dd85d2730d41">The Commission preliminarily believes that by enhancing the SROs&#8217; and the Commission&#8217;s ability to enforce the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> could help maintain or increase investor confidence in the fairness of the securities markets. Investor confidence may increase as the potential for the detection of illegal activity is increased and the risk of investment loss due to undetected illegal activity decreases. Bolstering investor confidence in the fairness of the securities markets may increase the level of investment, which could promote capital formation to the extent that the increase is allocated efficiently. This would promote capital formation because as capital is better allocated, issuers with the most productive capital needs may be better able to raise capital.</p>

With an audit trail designed to help the SROs reconstruct and analyze time-sequenced order and trading data, the SROs could more quickly investigate the nature and causes of unusual market movements or trading activity and initiate investigations and take regulatory actions where warranted. An increase in detected and prosecuted violations of the securities laws, rules, and regulations would likely act as deterrent to future violations. Likewise, the ability of the Commission to better understand unusual market activity, such as during a period of intense volatility, could lead to better oversight, or more focused regulation where warranted, of the causes of such activity. For example, the possibility of more prompt detection of illegal activity would likely deter future abusive or manipulative trading activity from being used to manipulate market prices to artificial levels or by accelerating a declining market in one or several securities. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> would help to ensure that markets function efficiently. As a result, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail would help promote the efficient functioning of markets, which should help enhance the protection of investors and further the public interest.</p>
          <p id="9d14ba58-379b-47ab-a072-c0b16d7121d4">Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed Rule, by creating one central repository to which each national securities exchange, national securities association, and their members would be required to provide the same data in the same format, could reduce or eliminate the need for each individual SRO to have it own disparate requirements. Elimination of often inconsistent regulation on members would promote efficiency because members would no longer be required to submit disparate data to multiple regulators pursuant to multiple, and sometimes inconsistent, SRO and Commission rules.</p>
          <p id="ba2b56a6-fd85-4936-a413-27b315f26325">The Commission requests comment on all aspects of this analysis and, in particular, on whether the proposed consolidated audit trail would place a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act, as well as the effect of the proposal on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The Commission also requests comment on the impact, if any, of the proposed Rule on investors&#8217; trading activities. Would the proposed Rule impact investors&#8217; incentives to engage in certain types of legal trading in NMS securities, or other products, on the exchanges or OTC markets that would be subject to the proposed Rule? If so, why, and what impact would that have on the competitiveness of the U.S. markets? Would the proposed Rule impact market participants&#8217; incentives to engage in certain types of illegal trading activity in products other than NMS securities or in other markets? If so, how so, and what if any steps should the Commission take to address the expected changes in behavior? Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for their views.</p>

As discussed above, currently many of the national securities exchanges and FINRA have audit trail rules and systems to track information relating to orders received and executed, or otherwise handled, in their respective markets. While the information gathered from these audit trail systems aids the SRO and Commission staff in their regulatory responsibility to surveil for compliance with SRO rules and the federal securities laws and regulations, the Commission preliminarily believes that existing audit trails are limited in their scope and effectiveness in varying ways.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-7" NAME="fr_pz184-7">410</a> In addition, while the SRO and Commission staff also currently receives information about orders and/or trades through the EBS system, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-8" NAME="fr_pz184-8">411</a> and from equity cleared reports, the information is limited, to varying degrees, in detail and scope. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-9" NAME="fr_pz184-9">412</a></p>

A consolidated audit trail also would enhance the ability of the Commission in investigating and preparing market reconstructions, and in understanding the causes of unusual market activity. Further, timely pursuit of potential violations can be important in seeking to freeze and recover any profits received from illegal activity.</p>

          <p id="a23b7feb-8fa1-4238-b47b-8d3dcebf3ac2">The proposed Rule would require that most of the information collected be reported on a real time basis, rather than on an &#8220;as requested&#8221; basis, and that all required information be submitted in a uniform format. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that even those small broker-dealers that already have systems in place for submitting order and transaction information to regulators upon request, or to comply with existing SRO audit trail rules, would need to make modifications to their existing order handling and trading systems to comply with the proposed Rule, or rely on outside vendors to provide a functionality that would provide information to the central repository.</p>

          <p id="f9dd0835-4ee3-47ce-8542-7d1613f76ea3">The Commission has considered whether it would more be more cost effective to enhance existing systems to achieve the proposed Rule&#8217;s objective, rather than create a central repository. For example, the Commission considered expanding the scope of the information collected by existing audit trails, the EBS system, and/or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>, but determined that this approach would not result in the creation of a comprehensive consolidated audit trail. Under such an approach, SROs would still need to check multiple repositories of data to gather information about trading activity occurring across markets. Further, the goal of capturing data in a uniform format would be complicated if data were collected by multiple repositories. In addition, this approach would not resolve concerns over how long it takes to obtain data when it is not available in real time, but only required to be provided upon request. Without the centralization of data in a uniform electronic format, the Commission preliminarily believes that the goals of the proposed Rule could not be achieved.</p>
          <p id="d6cea8d6-0064-4f83-9b48-b6d6e43a22d3">The Commission preliminarily believes that proposing a new uniform audit trail rule that would apply equally across all SROs and their members would be more efficient and effective than requiring each SRO to separately amend and enhance its existing order audit trail or EBS rules and systems, and amending <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>. The scope of the proposed audit trail &#8211; requiring each member and SRO to report the same information for each order, for each reportable event, in a uniform format, in real time, across all markets &#8211; is fundamentally different than what is collected under existing order audit trails, the EBS system, and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6c209f06cf4467ded67a798c4e027f90&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a>.</p>
          <p id="77f1ed02-6d00-47c4-8009-06ebcc8f64ef">The Commission also has considered allowing certain small broker-dealers to submit certain trading data in a manual, rather than an electronic, format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz189-4" NAME="fr_pz189-4">421</a> However, the Commission preliminarily does not believe that the intent and objectives of proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> could be achieved if small broker-dealers are subject to differing compliance or reporting requirements, such as manual reporting of data, or timetables. The Commission preliminarily believes that to be effective the consolidated audit trail should contain order and execution information from all broker-dealers, including small broker-dealers, in a uniform electronic format. Without this information, the SROs and the Commission would not have a complete and timely cross-market audit trail to utilize in their regulatory oversight of small broker-dealers, their customers, and the securities markets. Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that the timetable contained in the proposed Rule, which would give brokers-dealers two years after effectiveness of the NMS plan to implement the proposed requirements to collect and report the required information to the central repository, would allow small broker-dealers sufficient time to modify existing systems, or procure third party functionality, to comply with the proposed Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz190-5" NAME="fr_pz190-5">422</a></p>
          <p id="cb2ebb84-ad48-41d3-a17b-786190f8c0ae">Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that it has drafted the proposed Rule to be as straightforward as possible to achieve its objectives. Any simplification, consolidation or clarification of the Rule should occur for all entities, not just small broker-dealers. The Commission does not propose to dictate for entities of any size any particular design standards (e.g., technology) that must be employed to achieve the objectives of the proposed Rule. However, in order to provide consistent, comparable data to the central repository, the nature of the information collected is a design standard.</p>
          <p id="a9350e54-b1b5-4c4c-a6d4-3900197a6d08">The Commission would be able to rely on its exemptive authority under <a href="">Section 36 of the Exchange Act</a> to grant relief, when necessary, to small broker-dealers from the requirements of the proposed Rule. The Commission preliminarily believes that a wholesale exemption from the proposed Rule for small broker-dealers, however, would make it harder for the Commission and SROs to recognize the anticipated benefits of the consolidated audit trail.</p>

Indeed, the Commission believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail, if implemented, would have significantly enhanced the Commission&#8217;s ability to quickly reconstruct and analyze the severe market disruption that occurred on May 6, 2010. If approved and implemented, the proposal also would enhance the Commission&#8217;s ability to similarly respond to future severe market events.</p>

      <p>11 The Commission recently published for comment a proposal to establish a large trader reporting system. See <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2010/34-61908.pdf">Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61908</a> (April 14, 2010), <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/04/23/2010-9025/large-trader-reporting-system">75 FR 21456</a> (April 23, 2010) (&#8220;Large Trader Proposal&#8221;). Under that proposal, large traders would be issued unique identifiers that they would be required to provide to the broker-dealers that execute transactions on their behalf, and the broker-dealers would be required to maintain, and provide to the Commission upon request, transaction records for each large trader customer. The large trader proposal is designed to address in the near term the Commission's current need for access to more information about large traders and their activities. As discussed below, the Commission anticipates that the proposed consolidated audit trail discussed in this release, which is much broader in scope, would take a significant amount of time to fully implement. This proposal would require that, if the Large Trader proposal is adopted, the large trader identification number be reported to the central repository as part of the identifying customer information. See proposed <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(j)(2)</a>.</p>

      <p>96 The ISG was created in 1983 and its members include all of the registered national securities exchanges and FINRA. ISG states that its goals are to enhance intermarket surveillance, assure the integrity of trading, and provide investor protection. To achieve these goals, ISG members share data such as audit trail information and short interest data among themselves. ISG provides surveillance tools to supplement its participant members&#8217; existing surveillance systems, such as the ISG Unusual Activity Report and the Consolidated Equity Audit Trail. These reports are made available from SIAC to members of ISG and are intended to provide a consolidated view across all markets of trade, quote, and clearing activity. See comment letter from Brian F. Colby, Chairman, Intermarket Surveillance Group, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated June 18, 2003 (&#8220;ISG 2003 Comment Letter&#8221;) (commenting in response to the Intermarket Trading Concept Release).</p>

      <p>100 Of the commenters that clearly commented on the creation of a uniform intermarket audit trail, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs and Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg were in favor of the idea, and Bloomberg supported a consolidated audit trail for those SROs trading Nasdaq-listed securities. See Citigroup Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 6; Goldman Sachs and Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 3&#8211;4; and Bloomberg Tradebook Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 3. Brut, CBOE, and the NYSE did not appear to be in favor of a standardized intermarket audit trail. See Brut Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 5 (arguing for addressing improvements to surveillances falling short of Exchange Act requirements individually instead of &#8220;costly and comprehensive technology overhauls&#8221;); CBOE Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 2 (explaining that it &#8220;supports expanding the use of existing tools and enhancing [SRO] and Commission coordination to strengthen surveillance and to achieve more uniform regulation...&#8221; and noting that the Commission could &#8220;play a significant role in achieving uniform SRO regulation [by] establishing guiding principles on a variety of areas that affect all SROs.&#8221; CBOE also noted that there should be enhanced coordination of SRO regulatory efforts through ISG and through 17d-2 agreements); and NYSE Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 5 (suggesting linking SRO audit trails in the manner of the ISG Consolidated Audit Trail).</p>

      <p>104 See SIA Comment Letter, supra note 99, at 4. One commenter agreed that the Commission would be justified in requiring all SROs trading Nasdaq-listed securities to coordinate electronic audit trail systems with the NASD. See Bloomberg Tradebook Comment Letter, supra note 99. On the other hand, one commenter stated its belief that if there is a legitimate need to improve on the ISG audit trail, the markets should act jointly to do so, without being forced to adopt Nasdaq's proprietary audit trail.

      <p>150 As discussed, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposal would improve the ability of regulators to conduct timely and accurate trading analyses for market reconstructions and complex investigations, as well as inspections and examinations. Indeed, the Commission believes that the proposed consolidated audit trail, if implemented, would have significantly enhanced the Commission&#8217;s ability to quickly reconstruct and analyze the severe market disruption that occurred on May 6, 2010. If approved and implemented, the proposal also would enhance the Commission&#8217;s ability to similarly respond to future severe market events.</p>

      <p>156 Indirect access is when a non-member of an exchange accesses an exchange through a member. For example, to comply with regulatory obligations such as <a href="">Rule 611 of Regulation NMS</a> (<a href="">17 CFR 242.611</a>), exchanges increasingly rely on indirect access to other exchanges through member broker-dealers of the other exchanges, so called &#8220;private linkage&#8221; access. Sponsored access is one type of indirect access and is governed by exchange rules. See, e.g., Nasdaq Rule 4611(d). The Commission recently proposed rules that would address sponsored access to exchanges. See <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2010/34-61379.pdf">Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61379</a> (January 26, 2010), <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/01/29/2010-1856/purchases-of-certain-equity-securities-by-the-issuer-and-others">75 FR 4713</a> (January 29, 2010).</p>

As noted above, see supra note 12, FINRA currently is the only national securities association to which the proposal would apply, as the NFA is restricted to regulating its members who are registered as broker-dealers in security futures products due to its limited purpose registration with the Commission under <a href="">Section 15A(k) of the Exchange Act</a>, <a href="">15 U.S.C. 78o-3(k)</a>.

      <p>171 The Commission's Division of Enforcement has recently established an Office of Market Intelligence. This Office, among other things, conducts intake and triage of investor and industry referrals that are received by the Commission each year. Currently, a thorough review of referrals requires extensive resource allocation as the primary source for evaluating trading data is the EBS system. Expansion of the consolidated audit trail to non-NMS securities would allow that Office to evaluate the merits of each referral faster and more effectively, and more efficiently allocate enforcement resources to appropriate cases.</p>

      <p>205 For example, a member receives a customer order, and rather then sending the customer order as an agency order to an exchange or other marketplace to execute, the member creates an order for its proprietary account that it sends to an exchange or other marketplace to be executed. Once an execution occurs in the proprietary account, the member would then execute the customer order against its proprietary account. This process can be complicated by the member receiving and handling more than one customer order at a time, and creating one or more proprietary orders to send to one or more markets, and the manner in which the member allocates executions from its proprietary account among the customer orders.</p>

      <p>221 A broker-dealer has a legal duty to seek to obtain best execution of customer orders. See, e.g., Newton v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 135 F.3d 266, 269-70, 274 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 811 (1998); Certain Market Making Activities on Nasdaq, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 40900 (Jan. 11, 1999) (settled case) (citing Sinclair v. SEC, 444 F.2d 399 (2d Cir. 1971); Arleen Hughes, 27 SEC 629, 636 (1948), aff&#8217;d sub nom. Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). See also Order Execution Obligations, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 37619A (Sept. 6, 1996), 61 FR 48290 (Sept. 12, 1996) (&#8220;Order Handling Rules Release&#8221;). A broker-dealer&#8217;s duty of best execution derives from common law agency principles and fiduciary obligations, and is incorporated in SRO rules and, through judicial and Commission decisions, the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. See Order Handling Rules Release, 61 FR at 48322. See also Newton, 135 F.3d at 270. The duty of best execution requires broker-dealers to execute customers&#8217; trades at the most favorable terms reasonably available under the circumstances, i.e., at the best reasonably available price. Newton, 135 F.3d at 270. Newton also noted certain factors relevant to best execution - order size, trading characteristics of the security, speed of execution, clearing costs, and the cost and difficulty of executing an order in a particular market.

The Rule ensures that: (1) FINRA members make bona fide public offerings of securities at the offering price; (2) members do not withhold securities in a public offering for their own benefit or use such securities to reward persons who are in a position to direct future business to members; and (3) industry insiders, including FINRA members and their associated persons, do not take advantage of their insider position to purchase "new issues" for their own benefit at the expense of public customers. For example, information on commissions could help detect a transaction in the secondary market between an underwriter and an investor at an excessively high commission rate that is a &#8220;quid pro quo&#8221; for the underwriter allocating shares in a &#8220;hot&#8221; IPO to the investor.</p>

      <p>275 Dark pools are ATSs that do not provide their best-priced orders for inclusion in the consolidated quotation data. In general, dark pools offer trading services to institutional investors and others that seek to execute large trading interest in a manner that will minimize the movement of prices against the trading interest and thereby reduce trading costs. Dark pools fall within the statutory definition of an exchange, but are exempted if they comply with Regulation ATS.

      <p>296 The NBBO is used by SROs and the Commission to evaluate members for compliance with numerous regulatory requirements, such as the duty of best execution or <a href="">Rule 611 of Regulation NMS</a>.

An SRO would be able to compare order execution information to the NBBO information on a more timely basis because the order and execution information would be available on a real time basis and all of the information would be available in a compatible format in the same database.

      <p>297 See supra Section III.D.1.v. As discussed above, the proposed Rule would require that each report of the execution (in whole or in part) of an order sent to the central repository include a notation as to whether the execution was reported to the consolidated tape pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan or the OPRA Plan. This requirement should allow regulators to more efficiently evaluate certain trading activity. For example, trading patterns of reported and unreported trades may cause the staff of an SRO or the Commission to make further inquiry into the nature of the trading to ensure that the public was receiving accurate and timely information regarding executions and that market participants were continuing to comply with the trade reporting obligations under SRO rules. Similarly, patterns in the reported and unreported transactions could be indicia of market abuse, including failure to obtain best execution for customer orders or possible market manipulation. Being able to more efficiently compare the consolidated order execution data with the trades reported to the consolidated tape could thus be an important component of overall surveillance activity.</p>

      <p>342 This figure includes internal personnel time and external legal costs. Commission staff estimates that each exchange and association would expend (400 Attorney hours x $305 per hour) + (100 Compliance Manager hours x $258 per hour) + (220 Programmer Analyst hours x $193 per hour) + (120 Business Analyst hours x $194 per hour) = $213,540. The $305 per-hour figure for an Attorney; the $258 per hour figure for a Compliance Manager; the $193 per hour figure for a Programmer Analyst; and the $194 per hour figure for a Business Analysis (Intermediate) are from SIFMA&#8217;s Management &amp; Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2008, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. Commission staff also estimates that each exchange and association would outsource, on average, 50 hours of legal time, at an average hourly rate of $400. Thus, the Commission preliminarily estimates, on average, a total cost of $233,540 per SRO.
