      <p id="cdbf0ad3-4f66-4a49-ab91-f3253e679870">The Commission believes that the regulatory data infrastructure on which the SROs and the Commission currently must rely generally is outdated and inadequate to effectively oversee a complex, dispersed, and highly automated national market system. In performing their oversight responsibilities, regulators today must attempt to pull together disparate data from a variety of existing information systems lacking in completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and/or timeliness<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-4" NAME="fr_pz8-4">11</a>&#8212;a model that neither supports the efficient aggregation of data from multiple trading venues nor yields the type of complete and accurate market activity data needed for robust market oversight.</p>
      <p id="b113cbb7-f8dc-4a48-b2c3-845f69145690">Currently, FINRA and the exchanges maintain their own separate audit trail systems for trading activity, which vary in scope, required data elements and format. In performing their market oversight responsibilities, SRO and Commission Staffs must rely heavily on data from these various SRO audit trails. However, each of these systems has shortcomings in completeness, accuracy, accessibility, or timeliness. Some of these shortcomings are a result of the disparate nature of the systems, which makes it impractical, for example, to follow orders through their entire lifecycle as they may be routed, aggregated, re-routed, and disaggregated across multiple markets. These systems also lack key information useful for regulatory oversight, such as the identity of the customers who originate orders, or that two sets of orders may have been originated by the same customer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-3" NAME="fr_pz9-3">12</a> Although SRO and Commission Staffs also have access to sources of market activity data other than SRO audit trails, these sources likewise suffer from their own drawbacks.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-4" NAME="fr_pz9-4">13</a></p>
      <p id="ea20233e-6d29-43c2-82c7-ef3a24671f76">Recognizing these shortcomings, on July 11, 2012, the Commission adopted <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613 of Regulation NMS</a> under the Act,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-2" NAME="fr_pz10-2">14</a> which requires the SROs to submit an NMS plan to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated audit trail (&#8220;CAT&#8221;) that would capture customer and order event information for orders in NMS securities, across all markets, from the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or execution in a single, consolidated data source.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-3" NAME="fr_pz10-3">15</a> Specifically, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> requires the Participants to &#8220;jointly file &#8230; a national market system plan to govern the creation, implementation, and maintenance of a consolidated audit trail and Central Repository.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-4" NAME="fr_pz10-4">16</a> The purpose of the Plan, and the creation, implementation and maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail for the U.S. securities markets described therein, is to &#8220;substantially enhance the ability of the SROs and the Commission to oversee today&#8217;s securities markets and fulfill their responsibilities under the federal securities laws.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-5" NAME="fr_pz10-5">17</a> As contemplated by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, the CAT &#8220;will allow for the prompt and accurate recording of material information about all orders in NMS securities, including the identity of customers, as these orders are generated and then routed throughout the U.S. markets until execution, cancellation, or modification.

The Commission also noted that &#8220;the costs and benefits of creating a consolidated audit trail, and the consideration of specific costs as related to specific benefits, is more appropriately analyzed once the SROs narrow the expanded array of choices they have under the adopted Rule and develop a detailed NMS plan.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-5" NAME="fr_pz13-5">28</a> Accordingly, the Commission required the SROs to conduct an economic analysis and deferred the Commission&#8217;s own economic analysis of the actual creation, implementation, and maintenance of the CAT until after submission of the required NMS plan. In accordance with this approach, the Commission included its preliminary analysis and conclusions regarding the economic effects of the CAT NMS Plan when it published the CAT NMS Plan for public comment.</p>

However, the Plan notes that OATS cannot be entirely eliminated until all FINRA members who currently report to OATS are reporting to the Central Repository, and that there will likely be some period of dual reporting until FINRA can verify that the data in the Central Repository is of sufficient quality for surveillance purposes and that data reported to the Central Repository meets the Error Rate standards set out in the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-3" NAME="fr_pz95-3">472</a> With respect to rules and systems other than OATS, the CAT NMS Plan notes that based on preliminary industry analyses, broker-dealer recordkeeping and large trader reporting requirements under SEC Rule 17h-1 could potentially be eliminated.

Because the Participants will be more directly responsible for the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan, in the Commission&#8217;s view, it is appropriate that they make the judgment as to how to obtain the benefits of a consolidated audit trail in a way that is practicable and cost-effective in the first instance. The Commission&#8217;s review of an NMS plan is governed by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a> and, under that rule, approval is conditioned upon a finding that the proposed plan is &#8220;necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a national market system, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-3" NAME="fr_pz127-3">642</a> Further, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a> provides the Commission with the authority to approve an NMS plan, &#8220;with such changes or subject to such conditions as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-4" NAME="fr_pz127-4">643</a> In reviewing the policy choices made by the Participants in developing the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission has sought to ensure that they are supported by an adequate rationale, do not call into question the Plan&#8217;s satisfaction of the approval standard in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a>, and reasonably achieve the benefits of a consolidated audit trail without imposing unnecessary burdens. In addition, because of the evolving nature of the data captured by the CAT and the technology used, as well as the number of decisions still to be made in the process of implementing the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission has paid particular attention to the structures in place to guide decision-making going forward. These include the governance of the Company, the provisions made for Commission and other oversight, the standards established, and the development milestones provided for in the Plan.</p>
      <p id="61eaf896-9ece-4051-a3c0-1d81655f0a81">The Commission received 24 comment letters on the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAjD3T" NAME="fr_pAjD3T">644</a> The commenters included, among others, national securities exchanges, technology providers, academics, broker-dealers, investors, and organizations representing industry participants. Of the comment letters received regarding the Plan, 13 expressed general support,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-4" NAME="fr_pz128-4">645</a> 3 comment letters expressed opposition to the Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-5" NAME="fr_pz128-5">646</a> and 8 comment letters neither supported nor opposed the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-6" NAME="fr_pz128-6">647</a> Many of the commenters suggested modifications to certain provisions of the Plan or identified what they believed were deficiencies in the Plan.</p>
      <p id="0521264e-1084-4cdc-9f3b-2709a6e0f404">The most significant areas raised in the comment letters pertained to: (i) the security and confidentiality of CAT Data (especially of PII); (ii) the cost and funding of the CAT; (iii) the timing of the retirement of duplicative regulatory reporting systems; (iv) the implementation time frame; (v) governance (particularly with respect to industry representation); (vi) the clock synchronization standard; (vi) error rates; and (vii) an overall lack of detail in the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="5984a9f3-eeb2-4475-a0bc-68ead3a702d4">As discussed in detail below, the Commission has determined to approve the CAT NMS Plan, as amended, pursuant to <a href="">Section 11A of the Act</a><a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-7" NAME="fr_pz128-7">648</a> and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pASNUB" NAME="fr_pASNUB">649</a> The Commission believes that the Plan is reasonably designed to improve the completeness, accuracy, accessibility and timeliness of order and execution data used by regulators. The Commission believes that the Plan will facilitate regulators&#8217; access to more complete, accurate and timely audit trail data. The Plan will also allow for more efficient and effective surveillance and analysis, which will better enable regulators to detect misconduct, reconstruct market events, and assess potential regulatory changes. As a result, the CAT NMS Plan should significantly improve regulatory efforts by the SROs and the Commission, including market surveillance, market reconstructions, enforcement investigations, and examinations of market participants. The Commission believes that improved regulatory efforts, in turn, will strengthen the integrity and efficiency of the markets, which will enhance investor protection and increase capital formation.</p>
      <p id="92b2d67d-6f4c-4099-a354-cedb3b1b7b7b">As noted, commenters raised concerns about, and suggested alternatives to, certain Plan provisions. The Participants submitted five letters which responded to the comments and provided certain suggestions for amendments to the Plan, as discussed in detail below. After considering the proposed Plan, the issues raised by commenters, and the Participants&#8217; responses, the Commission has amended certain aspects of the Plan and has determined that the proposed Plan, as amended by the Commission, satisfies the standard of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a>.

As the Participants point out, the CAT NMS Plan is the vehicle through which they will fulfill key regulatory and oversight responsibilities. The Commission notes the Participants&#8217; statutory obligations as SROs, the opportunity for Advisory Committee input on the CAT NMS Plan decisions, the opportunity for public comment on Plan amendments, and close Commission oversight, when reaching that determination.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-5" NAME="fr_pz140-5">708</a></p>
          <p id="57a6be11-1a1b-427f-acec-76b342356ba7">Furthermore, the Commission notes that the current provisions, which allocate voting rights such that each Participant has one vote, is consistent with other NMS plans and recognizes that the obligations imposed by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> on the SROs are also imposed on each SRO independently. With respect to the limited use of a unanimous voting standard, the Commission believes that the Plan is reasonably designed to facilitate effective governance and notes that only the three extraordinary Operating Committee actions specified above require unanimity, whereas all other Operating Committee actions can be accomplished with either a Majority Vote or Supermajority Vote.</p>
          <p id="4e35f190-4492-4c8f-858b-569be9e9b548">The Commission notes that Commission Staff may observe all meetings (regular and special), including Executive Sessions, of the Operating Committee and Advisory Committee and receive all minutes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz141-8" NAME="fr_pz141-8">709</a> The Commission anticipates that only a few members of Commission Staff would observe any given meeting.</p>
          <p id="973af8c6-4d44-46b9-a1e6-5061dfc690be">The Commission also notes that independent of its review of the CAT NMS Plan, the EMSAC has been reviewing, among other things, the issues surrounding NMS plan governance. On June 10, 2016, the EMSAC presented its recommendations in this area to the Commission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz141-9" NAME="fr_pz141-9">710</a></p>
          <p id="1123c600-2d6b-44c9-988b-17b65b9ca64d">Finally, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Meetings of the Operating Committee">Section 4.4(b) of the Plan</a> to specify that the Operating Committee&#8217;s discretion to deviate from the treatment, as set forth therein, of persons submitting a Form 1 application to become a national securities exchange or persons submitting a Form X-15AA-A application to become a national securities association, must be reasonable and not impose any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on competition. The Commission is also amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article III - Participation, New Participants">Section 3.3(b)(v) of the Plan</a> to specify that the Operating Committee&#8217;s discretion, in considering other factors in determining the Participation Fee of a new Participant, must be reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory. The Commission believes these amendments are appropriate because they set forth in the CAT NMS Plan specific limitations with respect to the Operating Committee&#8217;s discretion that are consistent with existing SRO obligations under the Exchange Act.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz141-10" NAME="fr_pz141-10">711</a></p>

          <p id="7480c48f-6109-4f42-84cb-c5ee76be3f29">Regarding the size and composition of the Advisory Committee, the Participants recommended amending the Plan to include a service bureau representative, because service bureaus &#8220;perform audit trail reporting on behalf of their customers . . . [and] would provide a valuable perspective on how the CAT and any enhancements thereto would affect the service bureau clients, which often include a number of small and medium-sized firms.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz149-3" NAME="fr_pz149-3">749</a> The Participants also recommended augmenting the institutional investor representation on the Advisory Committee by including institutional investor representation by an adviser from registered funds, and increasing from two to three institutional investor representatives with at least one of the institutional investor representatives trading on behalf of an investment company or group of investment companies registered pursuant to the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&amp;edition=prelim&amp;req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-section80a-1&amp;num=0&amp;saved=%7CZ3JhbnVsZWlkOlVTQy1wcmVsaW0tdGl0bGUxNS1zZWN0aW9uODBhLTIz%7C%7C%7C0%7Cfalse%7Cprelim">Investment Company Act of 1940</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz149-4" NAME="fr_pz149-4">750</a> The Participants also suggested removing references in the Advisory Committee eligibility requirements for those institutional investors &#8220;on behalf of a public entity &#8230; and on behalf of a private entity,&#8221; which is in response to a comment noting the vagueness of the terms &#8220;public&#8221; and &#8220;private&#8221; with respect to institutional investors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz149-5" NAME="fr_pz149-5">751</a></p>
          <p id="a5c395f1-bf78-4b45-a0ba-66d2b80b3c17">The Participants, however, disagreed with commenters that the academic representative of the Advisory Committee should be limited to a financial economist because a general requirement that &#8220;a member of academia with expertise in the securities industry or any other industry relevant to the operation of the CAT System,&#8221; does not preclude a financial economist serving on the Advisory Committee so long as they have the relevant expertise.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pArX" NAME="fr_pArX">752</a> The Participants also disagreed with commenters that members of industry trade groups should also serve on the Advisory Committee, noting that the CAT NMS Plan includes a variety of representatives from the members of such trade groups and would provide &#8220;a meaningful opportunity for the representation of the views of industry trade groups.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz150-3" NAME="fr_pz150-3">753</a> Furthermore, the Participants disagreed with commenters who advocated increasing the number of broker-dealer representatives on the Advisory Committee from seven to twelve, and increasing the size of the Advisory Committee from twelve to twenty members. The Participants noted that, in &#8220;balancing the goal of having a sufficient cross section of representation with the goal of having a well-run committee,&#8221; seven broker-dealers of varying sizes and business types would provide &#8220;significant opportunity to provide [broker-dealers&#8217;] views&#8221; and increasing an Advisory Committee from twelve to twenty creates a committee structure that would &#8220;likely hamper, rather than facilitate,&#8221; discussion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz150-4" NAME="fr_pz150-4">754</a></p>
          <p id="08d1f1b1-78b5-4c94-ae6b-f0cf1ef89c2f">In response to commenters recommending a more active and participatory role in operation of the CAT for non-SRO stakeholders, the Participants stated that the Plan strikes an appropriate balance between providing the &#8220;industry with an active role in governance while recognizing the Participants&#8217; regulatory obligations with regard to the CAT.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAJH" NAME="fr_pAJH">755</a> In response to a commenter recommending that Advisory Committee members be selected by broker-dealer representatives, the Participants stated their belief that the Operating Committee should select the members, but agreed with commenters that the Advisory Committee should be permitted to advise the Operating Committee regarding potential Advisory Committee members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-3" NAME="fr_pz151-3">756</a> The Participants suggested that the CAT NMS Plan be amended to permit the Advisory Committee to advise the Operating Committee on Advisory Committee member selection, provided however, that the Operating Committee in its sole discretion would select members of the Advisory Committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-4" NAME="fr_pz151-4">757</a></p>
          <p id="db48afa2-27b6-4568-b52f-e23f39a23f32">In response to comments recommending formalized modes of written communication between the Operating Committee and the Advisory Committee, the Participants recommended that the CAT NMS Plan remain unchanged.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-5" NAME="fr_pz151-5">758</a> In support, the Participants stated their belief that the proposed structure adequately addresses the commenters&#8217; concerns, while recognizing the need for the Participants to have the opportunity to discuss certain matters, particularly certain regulatory and security issues, without the participation of the industry.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-6" NAME="fr_pz151-6">759</a> The Participants also noted that the Advisory Committee is permitted to attend all of the non-Executive Session Operating Committee meetings, where information concerning the operation of the CAT is received (subject to the Operating Committee&#8217;s authority to determine the scope and content of information supplied to the Advisory Committee).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAxp" NAME="fr_pAxp">760</a> Further, the Participants stated that minutes, subject to customary exceptions for confidentiality and privilege considerations, will be provided to the Advisory Committee. Finally, the Participants did not support instituting formalized modes of written communication between the Operating Committee and the Advisory Committee because such &#8220;an overly formulaic approach to [Operating Committee] interactions&#8221; would &#8220;hamper, rather than enhance, [Operating Committee] interactions with the Advisory Committee.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz152-3" NAME="fr_pz152-3">761</a></p>
          <p id="ad6530c7-f31e-4b8a-8b70-f27b5b920317">With respect to comments recommending narrowing the use of Operating Committee Executive Sessions, the Participants stated their belief that the Operating Committee&#8217;s capabilities to meet in Executive Session are appropriate and cited the Commission&#8217;s statement in the Adopting Release that: &#8220;meet[ing] in [E]xecutive [S]ession without members of the Advisory Committee appropriately balances the need to provide a mechanism for industry input into the operation of the central repository, against the regulatory imperative that the operations and decisions regarding the consolidated audit trail be made by SROs who have a statutory obligation to regulate the securities markets, rather than by members of the SROs, who have no corresponding statutory obligation to oversee the securities markets.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz152-4" NAME="fr_pz152-4">762</a> The Participants represented that their intended use of an Executive Session is for limited purposes requiring confidentiality and offered four examples: matters that present an actual or potential conflict of interest for Advisory Committee members (e.g., relating to member&#8217;s regulatory compliance); discussion of actual or potential litigation; CAT security issues; and personnel issues. The Participants also noted that Executive Sessions must be called by a Majority Vote and that the meeting minutes are recorded, subject to confidentiality and attorney-client privilege considerations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAxzt" NAME="fr_pAxzt">763</a></p>
          <p id="19e25a7e-1443-4179-b22c-8561c1ea05b0">Finally, in response to comments that the Advisory Committee should form before the approval of the CAT NMS Plan, the Participants noted that the Plan itself provides for the establishment of the Operating Committee and the Advisory Committee and thus cannot be formed until the Commission approves the Plan. The Participants also noted that the DAG provides the Participants with &#8220;advice regarding the development of the Plan from an industry perspective.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AqfP" NAME="fr_AqfP">764</a></p>
          <p id="18de3c84-40c4-4291-b92b-f4650c66fef9">For reasons discussed below, the Commission finds reasonable the Participants&#8217; suggested modifications to add a service bureau representative, increase the number of institutional investor representatives on the Advisory Committee, remove terms that create vagueness for the institutional investor representative categories, and make the applicable conforming changes to <a href="">Section 4.13 of the Plan</a>. Accordingly, after considering the comments, the Commission is amending <a href="">Section 4.13 of the Plan</a> to include a service bureau representative, increase the number of institutional investor representatives from two (2) to three (3), and remove the terms that a commenter identified as creating vagueness with respect to the institutional investor category.</p>
          <p id="e4e5092a-f5ce-4d23-bf2b-000924c90c8b">The Commission understands that service bureaus frequently serve a core role in reporting CAT Data on behalf of broker-dealers, and as such, the Commission finds appropriate their inclusion as an Advisory Committee member. Further, the Commission finds the increase from two to three members on the Advisory Committee representing institutional investors, as well as removing the references to &#8220;on behalf of a public entity&#8221; and &#8220;on behalf of a private entity&#8221; due to the vagueness of such terms with respect to institutional investor Advisory Committee members, to be reasonable responses to commenters seeking additional representation and clarity. The Commission also agrees with the Participants that it is reasonable to not mandate inclusion of representatives on the Advisory Committee from industry and trade associations, given the existing substantial industry representation on the Advisory Committee, which is reasonably designed to ensure a wide range of meaningful industry perspectives.</p>
          <p id="efcd2b69-a5b1-492e-bfbc-fe27ed734c2f">The Commission agrees with commenters who argued that the academic representative on the Advisory Committee should be a financial economist. The Commission acknowledges the Participants&#8217; response that a financial economist is not precluded from serving as the academic representative of the Advisory Committee, but the Commission believes that specifying that the academic representative must be a financial economist is appropriate to ensure the Advisory Committee and the Operating Committee have access to such expertise in assessing the CAT&#8217;s operations and development. Accordingly, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Advisory Committee">Section 4.13(b)(ix) of the Plan</a> to specify that the academic representative on the Advisory Committee must be a financial economist.</p>
          <p id="e89c3029-c06f-46ea-bcb2-37cf1c819b7a">The Commission agrees with the Participants&#8217; suggestion, in response to commenters, to permit the Advisory Committee to recommend Advisory Committee candidates to the Operating Committee. Accordingly, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Advisory Committee">Section 4.13(d) of the Plan</a> to permit the Advisory Committee to recommend Advisory Committee candidates to the Operating Committee, but notes that the Operating Committee still maintains the sole discretion to select members of the Advisory Committee.</p>
          <p id="62a2e885-79c2-444b-bb14-138045f8c75d">The Commission believes the amendment is reasonably designed to ensure a robust selection process for Advisory Committee membership that identifies candidates that best represent the industry perspective. With respect to the comment suggesting that the Advisory Committee be established before the approval of the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission notes it would be premature and technically not possible to establish an advisory committee to an NMS plan before such plan has been approved by the Commission. Moreover, the Commission notes that the interests of the industry and other stakeholders have been represented through the DAG, the public comment process, and through the SROs themselves as the CAT NMS Plan has been developed.</p>
          <p id="70dc00bc-5abe-4839-a9fa-e3df9dc6ea49">The Commission is amending the Executive Sessions provision in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Meetings of the Operating Committee">Section 4.4(a) of the Plan</a>, as well as the Advisory Committee provision in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Advisory Committee">Section 4.13(b) of the Plan</a> related to the Commission&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer (or equivalent) being an observer of the Advisory Committee. As the Commission is responsible for regulatory oversight of the Participants and the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Plan to expressly provide that Commission Staff may attend all CAT NMS Plan meetings, including those held in Executive Session. Similarly, because the Commission has broad regulatory responsibility for the Plan, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate to limit to the Commission&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer (or equivalent) the right to serve as an observer at Advisory Committee meetings. Accordingly, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Meetings of the Operating Committee">Sections 4.4(a)</a> and <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Advisory Committee">4.13(b)</a> to provide that Commission Staff may attend Executive Sessions, and to permit the Commission to select the Commission representative to observe Advisory Committee meetings. The Commission anticipates that only a few members of Commission Staff would observe any given meeting.</p>
          <p id="4fe44cdf-c062-4e2d-b56b-6df9fab7e878">The Commission also is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Advisory Committee">Section 4.13(e) of the Plan</a> in response to comments to provide that the Advisory Committee shall receive the same documents and information concerning the operation of the Central Repository as the Operating Committee. The Operating Committee may, however, withhold such information to the extent it reasonably determines such information requires confidential treatment. Although the Plan as filed permits Advisory Committee members to attend all of the non-Executive Session Operating Committee meetings, with respect to information concerning the operation of the CAT, it allows the Operating Committee broad discretion to determine the scope and content of information supplied to the Advisory Committee. The Commission believes it is important for the Advisory Committee to fulfill its role that its members receive full information on Plan operations (other than confidential information) and that it is therefore appropriate to amend <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Advisory Committee">Section 4.13(e) of the Plan</a> accordingly.</p>
          <p id="56a86d59-098c-436a-af17-c26553395dd7">With respect to the other comments regarding authority, composition and role of the Advisory Committee, as well as the use of the Operating Committee Executive Sessions, the Commission notes that the Plan provisions relating to the Advisory Committee and the Operating Committee Executive Sessions are similar to those in other NMS plans and are, therefore, reasonable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-6" NAME="fr_pz156-6">765</a></p>

          <p id="90cdc58e-209a-450a-b8a0-c3755233150b">The CAT NMS Plan requires the Company to appoint a CISO and a CCO, who shall be employees solely of the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-7" NAME="fr_pz156-7">766</a> The Plan acknowledges that the CISO and CCO may have fiduciary and other similar duties to the Plan Processor pursuant to their employment with the Plan Processor, and the Plan, as proposed, sets forth that to the extent permitted by law, the CISO and CCO will have no fiduciary or similar duties to the Company.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-4" NAME="fr_pz157-4">767</a></p>
          <p id="25dc3813-efd7-47f6-91e2-79f6d9cba5b6">One commenter expressed concern that appointing a CISO and CCO who would both be officers of the Company and employees of the Plan Processor &#8220;creates a potential conflict of interest that would undermine the ability of these officers to effectively carry out their responsibilities under the CAT NMS Plan because they would owe a fiduciary duty to the Plan Processor rather than to the [Company].&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-5" NAME="fr_pz157-5">768</a> This commenter recommended that the officers of the Company should be required to act in the best interest of the [Company] to avoid conflicts of interest in carrying out their oversight activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-6" NAME="fr_pz157-6">769</a> In addition, this commenter suggested that the CAT NMS Plan impose a fiduciary duty on the CISO and CCO, or at a minimum require the Plan Processor to select individuals who do not have a fiduciary duty to the Plan Processor to serve in these roles.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-7" NAME="fr_pz157-7">770</a></p>
          <p id="78e7099d-9757-4153-9f7e-f0181949dcb5">In response to these comments, the Participants suggested that the CAT NMS Plan be changed so that all Officers of the Company, including the CISO and CCO, have fiduciary duties to the Company in the same manner and extent as an officer of a Delaware corporation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-8" NAME="fr_pz157-8">771</a> The Participants also represented that the Operating Committee, in an agreement with the Plan Processor, will have the Plan Processor acknowledge that the Officers of the Company will owe fiduciary duties to the Company, and to the extent that the duties owed to the Company by the Officers of the Company, including the CISO or CCO, conflict with any duties owed to the Plan Processor, the duties to the Company should control.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz158-4" NAME="fr_pz158-4">772</a></p>
          <p id="e13fd077-c734-401c-96a5-5f38868f9f30">The Commission believes that the suggested modifications by the Participants in response to comments about potential conflicts of interest are reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission is amending Section 4.7(c) of the Plan so that each Officer shall have the same fiduciary duties and obligations to the Company as a comparable officer of a Delaware corporation and in all cases shall conduct the business of the Company and execute his or her duties and obligations in good faith and in the manner that the Officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company. Furthermore, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IV - Management of the Company, Officers of the Company">Section 4.6(a) of the Plan</a> to codify the Participants&#8217; representation that that the Operating Committee, in an agreement with the Plan Processor, will have the Plan Processor acknowledge that the Officers of the Company will owe fiduciary duties to the Company, and to the extent that the duties owed to the Company by the Officers of the Company, including the CISO or CCO, conflict with any duties owed to the Plan Processor, the duties to the Company should control.</p>
          <p id="a936fa7c-6534-4577-b4e0-47119e143e29">The Commission believes that amending the CAT NMS Plan to expressly affirm the Officers&#8217; fiduciary duties or similar duties or obligations to the Company provides clarity and assurances that the Officers will act in the best interests of the Company.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz158-5" NAME="fr_pz158-5">773</a> The Commission also believes it is reasonable, as the Participants have suggested in their response to comments, to have the Company and the Plan Processor enter into an agreement that specifies not only that Officers have fiduciary duties and obligations to the Company, but that if such Officers may have competing duties and obligations owed to the Company and to the Plan Processor, the duties and obligations to the Company should control. At this time, it is unclear what competing duties and obligations Officers may owe to the Company and the Plan Processor. While in many cases, the Officers&#8217; duties towards the Plan Processor and the Company are likely to be aligned, there may be circumstances (e.g., related to the performance of the Plan Processor) where such duties may conflict and the Commission finds reasonable that in such circumstances, the duties to the Company should control in order to mitigate any conflict between the interests of the Plan Processor and those of the Company in administering the CAT. The Commission further notes that the CAT NMS Plan provides reasonable oversight of the Officers by the Operating Committee, for example, the Plan requires: (i) the Operating Committee to approve the CISO and CCO with a Supermajority Vote<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-2" NAME="fr_pz159-2">774</a>; (ii) the CISO and CCO to devote, with minor exceptions, their entire working time to serving as the CISO and CCO<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-3" NAME="fr_pz159-3">775</a>; (iii) the Operating Committee to oversee that the Plan Processor allocates appropriate resources for the CISO and CCO to fulfill their obligations<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-4" NAME="fr_pz159-4">776</a>; (iv) the CISO and CCO to report directly to the Operating Committee with respect to their duties<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-5" NAME="fr_pz159-5">777</a>; (v) the compensation of the CISO and CCO to be subject to the Operating Committee&#8217;s review and approval<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-6" NAME="fr_pz159-6">778</a>; and (vi) an annual performance review of the CISO and CCO to be conducted by the Operating Committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-7" NAME="fr_pz159-7">779</a></p>

          <p id="327ebbdb-0d60-47e0-9518-af79e49224ab">Two commenters recommended that the Company governance structure include an audit committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz161-15" NAME="fr_pz161-15">789</a> One commenter noted that the audit committee should be comprised of mostly independent directors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz161-16" NAME="fr_pz161-16">790</a> Another commenter stated the audit committee should be responsible for the oversight of how the CAT&#8217;s revenue sources are used for regulatory purposes, and that the costs and financing of the CAT must be fully transparent and publicly disclosed in annual reports, including audited financial statements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAoZI" NAME="fr_pAoZI">791</a></p>
          <p id="f4f15105-ceba-4562-a091-145635c09304">Finally, one commenter suggested that the SROs should coordinate the administration of the CAT through a single centralized body from a legal, administrative, supervisory and enforcement perspective.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz162-3" NAME="fr_pz162-3">792</a> The commenter recommended amending the Plan to require this coordination, and suggested that such coordination could be facilitated through agreements under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117d_62">SEC Rule 17d-2</a>, regulatory service agreements or some combination thereof.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz162-4" NAME="fr_pz162-4">793</a> In support of this view, the commenter noted that different CAT-related compliance requirements among the SROs might arise and subject firms to duplicative regulation and enforcement, with the accompanying inefficiencies, additional costs, and potential inconsistencies.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz162-5" NAME="fr_pz162-5">794</a></p>

The Commission, however, highlights that the Participants are performing roles specified pursuant to obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder and remain under the direct oversight of the Commission. With respect to comments expressing concerns that the Participants may be in a position to commercialize the respective Raw Data reported by each SRO submitting to the CAT, order and execution information is already collected by SROs from its members and they are permitted under current law to commercialize this data (e.g., direct market feeds, provided that the terms are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pACE0" NAME="fr_pACE0">799</a>) subject to appropriate rule filings and oversight by the Commission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz164-5" NAME="fr_pz164-5">800</a> Thus, the Plan does not expand the Participants&#8217; ability to commercialize their Raw Data beyond what is currently permitted.</p>
          <p id="3e8ad246-c5f9-4ae8-b5b4-36b30c3cbc3c">With respect to comments that suggested that the Participants should not oversee and control the CAT, but that instead it should be under the Commission&#8217;s direct and sole control, the Commission notes that in the Adopting Release, the Commission mandated that the Participants develop an NMS plan for the development and operation of the CAT. As such, the CAT NMS Plan, as noticed, whereby the Participants directly manage the CAT, was in furtherance of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> as adopted. Additionally, because the Participants, as SROs, currently serve as front-line regulators of many aspects of the securities markets, including administering the existing sources of regulatory data, the Commission believes they are well positioned to oversee the CAT. Moreover, the Commission believes that any potential conflicts arising from the status of certain Participants as for profit enterprises are reasonably addressed through the Plan provisions and Commission oversight.</p>
          <p id="ba91288e-8949-47b2-a3f6-63acc0658c7b">The Commission concurs with the Participants that it is reasonable for the Company not to have an audit committee at this time. Further, the Participants are permitted to form an audit committee, as a subcommittee of the Operating Committee. The Commission notes that the absence of a requirement for an audit committee is consistent with other NMS plans.</p>
          <p id="8457418b-c1b5-4d90-9aca-f07eabbcc623"><a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IX - Records and Accounting Reports; Reports, Accounting">Section 9.2(a) of the Plan</a> states that the Operating Committee shall maintain a system of accounting for the Company established and administered in accordance with GAAP (or another standard if determined appropriate by the Operating Committee). <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IX - Records and Accounting Reports; Reports, Accounting">Section 9.2(a)</a> also requires, among other things, that the Company prepare and provide to each Participant an audited balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flow, to the extent the Operating Committee deems advisable. In addition, <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IX - Records and Accounting Reports; Reports, Accounting">Section 9.2(c) of the Plan</a> states that all matters concerning accounting procedures shall be determined by the Operating Committee. The Participants recommended that the Commission amend <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IX - Records and Accounting Reports; Reports, Accounting">Section 9.2(a)</a> to eliminate the flexibility for the Company to administer a system of accounting in accordance with non-GAAP standards, thus requiring that all financial statements or information that may be supplied to the Participants shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz165-3" NAME="fr_pz165-3">801</a> In addition, the Participants recommended amending the Plan to eliminate the discretion of the Operating Committee to provide financials only if it deems advisable and instead to require that the Company&#8217;s audited annual balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows be audited by an independent public accounting firm and made publicly available.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA_PP" NAME="fr_pA_PP">802</a> The Commission believes that the changes recommended by the Participants are reasonable because they will promote greater accuracy and transparency with respect to the Company&#8217;s financial accounting and is therefore amending the Plan accordingly.</p>

The Participants recommended that the Commission amend the Plan to change this timeframe to 180 days after the Plan Processor&#8217;s fiscal year end to provide further flexibility to the Plan Processor with respect to the preparation of its financial statements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz166-4" NAME="fr_pz166-4">803</a> The Commission believes that it is reasonable to provide this additional flexibility and is therefore amending the Plan accordingly.</p>
          <p id="a79b94fb-dc05-4a73-bd53-35ae78f3c518">The Commission also agrees with the commenters and Participants that a coordinated approach to self-regulatory oversight may have benefits, such as regulatory efficiencies and consistency, but believes that it is reasonable for such an arrangement to be considered by the Participants after the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s approval rather than mandating a specific approach for SRO coordination under the Plan at this time&#8212;as the Plan Processor has not been selected nor has the CAT System been developed. The Commission nevertheless notes that, as described above, it is amending the CAT NMS Plan to require a written assessment by the Participants within 12 months of effectiveness of the Plan, considering coordinated surveillance (e.g., entering into <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117d_62">Rule 17d-2</a> agreements, regulatory services agreements or other arrangements, to facilitate regulatory coordination).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz166-5" NAME="fr_pz166-5">804</a></p>
          <p id="2398cb85-8051-485d-9041-deda22169d9d">Finally, the Commission notes that the CAT NMS Plan provides that books and records of the CAT LLC shall be made available to the Commission upon &#8220;reasonable request.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz166-6" NAME="fr_pz166-6">805</a> Because the CAT LLC is a facility of the Participants, the Commission has the right to the books and records of CAT LLC &#8220;upon request&#8221; under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=59d7c33049bb83345d55626cd6e3333d&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_61">Exchange Act Rule 17a-1</a>,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pACa5" NAME="fr_pACa5">806</a> and therefore is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article IX - Records and Accounting Reports; Reports, Books and Records">Section 9.1 of the Plan</a> to delete the requirement that any request for the CAT LLC&#8217;s books and records be &#8220;reasonable.&#8221;</p>

        <p id="d3adc002-dded-4af5-93e6-dbd77e2baa76">In response to the comments to accelerate the Plan Processor selection process, the Participants acknowledged that the selection of the Plan Processor will likely affect implementation issues and related costs,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz168-4" NAME="fr_pz168-4">815</a> but that it is not feasible to accelerate the selection of the Plan Processor prior to the Commission&#8217;s approval of the Plan.

        <p id="6e1d029b-c3dd-4f07-b432-35969c85d5f8">In response to the comment in support for a specific Bidder, the Participants stated that they determined that utilizing a competitive bidding process to select the Plan Processor was the most appropriate way to promote an innovative and efficient CAT solution.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz168-7" NAME="fr_pz168-7">818</a> Pursuant to that process, the Participants noted that they have reduced the number of Bidders to three Shortlisted Bidders.</p>
        <p id="1a62042a-fd3b-49fe-9c0a-55c4759f2824">In response to the comment to re-open the Plan Processor&#8217;s agreement with the CAT LLC every five years and to provide a process for public input on the agreement, the Participants stated that they agree that it is important to ensure that the CAT solution remains effective and efficient going forward.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAf6o" NAME="fr_pAf6o">819</a> Accordingly, the Participants noted that they have proposed a process for regularly reviewing the performance of the Plan Processor throughout the term of the Plan Processor&#8217;s agreement and for modifying it if necessary to avoid an outdated CAT solution. The Participants added that, as set forth in the Plan, the Operating Committee will review the Plan Processor&#8217;s performance under the Plan at least once each year, or more often than once each year upon the request of two or more Participants that are not Affiliated Participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz169-3" NAME="fr_pz169-3">820</a> In addition, the Participants noted that the Plan sets forth the process for removing the Plan Processor. Specifically, the Participants noted that the Operating Committee, by Supermajority Vote, may remove the Plan Processor from such position at any time, and that the Operating Committee may, by Majority Vote, remove the Plan Processor from such position at any time if it determines that the Plan Processor has failed to perform its functions in a reasonably acceptable manner in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. The Participants stated that if they were to vote to remove the Plan Processor, the Operating Committee would select a new Plan Processor through a competitive bidding process.</p>
        <p id="02cf04b1-1c6b-4d58-a496-59bbddda4795">In approving the Selection Plan, the Commission stated that the Selection Plan is reasonably designed to achieve its objective of facilitating the development of the CAT NMS Plan and the selection of the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AONd" NAME="fr_AONd">821</a> The Commission also found that the Selection Plan is reasonably designed to govern the process by which the SROs will formulate and submit the CAT NMS Plan, including the review, evaluation, and narrowing down of Bids in response to the RFP, and ultimately choosing the Plan Processor that will build, operate, and maintain the consolidated audit trail.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AaVo" NAME="fr_AaVo">822</a> The Commission believes that the process set out in the Selection Plan for selecting a Plan Processor remains a reasonable approach, which will facilitate the selection of Plan Processor through a fair, transparent and competitive process and that no modifications to the Selection Plan are required to meet the approval standard. In response to the commenters recommending that the Plan Processor selection process be accelerated, the Commission agrees with the Participants that changes to the CAT NMS Plan that are being made in this Order may be relevant to the selection of the Plan Processor. The Commission believes that selecting the Plan Processor within two months of Plan approval, rather than prior to Plan approval, will allow the remaining Bidders to consider the CAT NMS Plan, as amended and approved by the Commission, and to make any necessary modifications to their Bids, which will enable the Participants to make a more fully informed decision on the Plan Processor in light of the amended and approved CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz170-3" NAME="fr_pz170-3">823</a> The Commission believes this timeframe to select the Plan Processor&#8212;two months following Commission approval of the Plan&#8212;will not result in the untimely release of the Technical Specifications.</p>
        <p id="ce35e9ae-ee46-4778-a0fe-8551f0d9ac6a">In response to the comment that offered support for a specific Bidder, the Commission agrees with the Participants that the competitive bidding process to select the Plan Processor is a reasonable and effective way to choose a Plan Processor and thus believes that the process set forth in the Selection Plan should be permitted to continue. In response to the commenter that recommended that the Commission re-open the Plan Processor&#8217;s agreement with the CAT LLC every five years and provide a process for public input on the agreement, the Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan already contains provisions that permit the reevaluation&#8212;and possible replacement&#8212;of the Plan Processor. Thus, the Commission is not amending the plan to require that the Plan Processor&#8217;s agreement with the CAT LLC be reevaluated every five years.</p>
        <p id="7ed97bed-a483-439e-abbe-30fcf62a2b73">Finally, in response to the commenter that stated that the Plan does not provide sufficient incentives for the Plan Processor and the Participants to incorporate new technology, innovate and reduce the costs of the CAT System, the Commission believes that requirements for regular evaluations of the operation of the CAT, the identification of potential improvements, and the delivery of a written assessment to the Commission, as well as the Plan&#8217;s provisions regarding the possible removal of the Plan Processor provide sufficient incentives for the Plan Processor and the Participants in these areas.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz171-11" NAME="fr_pz171-11">824</a></p>

The commenter argued that the exemption is necessary to keep currently-exempt firms in business due to the high costs that CAT reporting would impose.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz172-4" NAME="fr_pz172-4">827</a> This commenter further argued that the requested exemption for OATS-exempt firms would not be the same as an exemption for &#8220;small firms,&#8221; and that wrongdoers would not fall within this exemption because of the limitations on the level of market activity, the voluntary restrictions from operations such as market making and trading with customers, the use of manual orders, and the expected high levels of compliance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz172-5" NAME="fr_pz172-5">828</a></p>

          <p id="a10400e8-9a4e-49be-8134-3fc999d11407">In response to the commenter&#8217;s request that OATS-exempt firms also be exempted from reporting to the CAT, the Commission believes that completely exempting any group of broker-dealers from reporting requirements would be contradictory to the goal of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, which is to create an accurate, complete, accessible and timely audit trail.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-3" NAME="fr_pz173-3">831</a> To permit such an exemption would eliminate the collection of audit trail information from a segment of broker-dealers and would thus result in an audit trail that does not capture all orders by all participants in the securities markets. The Commission believes that the CAT should contain data from all broker-dealers, including those that may appear to be at low risk for wrong-doing based on their history of compliance or business model. Regulators will not only use the CAT for surveillance and investigations, but also for market reconstructions and market analyses.

          <p id="fb498537-c8b2-4888-8343-febc8a99dcbf">Three commenters, however, recommended that the format be specified in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-13" NAME="fr_pz174-13">840</a> One commenter argued that mandating an approach in the Plan, rather than waiting for the Technical Specifications, would give the industry more time to develop approaches to reporting using that format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-3" NAME="fr_pz175-3">841</a> The commenter also argued that if the format is not known until the Technical Specifications are published, this would limit the opportunity to make changes to the format, if necessary, without disrupting the implementation schedule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-4" NAME="fr_pz175-4">842</a> The commenter suggested that at least guidelines for a messaging protocol be included in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-5" NAME="fr_pz175-5">843</a></p>

Finally, the commenter represented that FIX can handle any identifier, including LEI, and can support the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s use of Customer-ID, average price processing, options reporting, and the daisy chain approach for reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz1-6" NAME="fr_pz1-6">849</a></p>
          <p id="7da260d9-3110-4d5e-abfa-1cccba640deb">One commenter stated that while mandating one uniform format would reduce the burden on the Central Repository for consolidating and storing data, it would impose a burden on CAT Reporters to accurately translate their current reporting format into a uniform CAT interface that could result in more errors than if the conversion to a uniform format occurred at the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz1-7" NAME="fr_pz1-7">850</a> Conversely, another commenter cautioned that requiring one uniform format would create a monopoly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz1-8" NAME="fr_pz1-8">851</a></p>
          <p id="4eace5b5-87e3-4578-87cc-fbb245b0141d">One commenter argued that while data reported in a non-uniform format can be reliably converted into a uniform format, there are benefits to using a uniform format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz1-9" NAME="fr_pz1-9">852</a> Specifically, the commenter stated that using a uniform format can reduce data integrity issues within the Plan Processor, reduce data processing times, lower error correction rates between T+1 and T+3, reduce time and resources needed to on-board participants, and improve data accuracy and consistency across broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-5" NAME="fr_pz2-5">853</a> The commenter also stated that use of a uniform format would improve data completeness because exact fields and standards would be defined.</p>
          <p id="ba3b9bd1-c8ee-4fb6-806f-8d0bd43f7a2c">In their response, the Participants stated that they do not believe that the Plan should mandate a specific format for reporting to the Central Repository, but rather should allow the Bidders to use discretion in selecting the format that will work most efficiently with their solution.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-6" NAME="fr_pz2-6">854</a> The Participants stated that the nature of data ingestion is key to the architecture of the CAT and therefore the Plan does not mandate a data ingestion format, but allows the Plan Processor to determine the format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-7" NAME="fr_pz2-7">855</a> The Participants also noted that the remaining three Bidders propose accepting existing messaging protocols (e.g., FIX), rather than requiring CAT Reporters to use a new format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-8" NAME="fr_pz2-8">856</a> The Participants stated that when they evaluate each Bidder&#8217;s solution, they will consider whether the Bidder&#8217;s proposed approach for a message format is easily understood and adoptable by the industry. The Participants also stated that they will take into consideration each Bidder&#8217;s ability &#8220;to reliably and accurately convert data to a uniform electronic format for consolidation and storage, regardless of the message formats in with the CAT Reporters would be required to report data to the Central Repository.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-9" NAME="fr_pz2-9">857</a></p>
          <p id="82aa8809-e0b8-44ce-ae19-d1b5f879a894">The Commission believes it is reasonable to allow the Plan Processor to determine the electronic format in which data must be reported, and whether the format is uniform or whether multiple formats can be used to report CAT Data. The Commission recognizes that if a format were mandated in the CAT NMS Plan, CAT Reporters would have the information necessary to accommodate the format sooner than if they need to wait for the Plan Processor to choose the format. Although the Commission recognizes the benefit of early notice, mandating a particular format(s) in the Plan could limit the Plan Processor&#8217;s options for designing the operation of the CAT as envisioned. Moreover, the Commission notes that the Participants have stated that they will consider whether a Bidder has proposed a format that is easily understood and adoptable by the industry.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-5" NAME="fr_pz3-5">858</a> Further, because the Plan contemplates there will be iterations of the Technical Specifications, as well as time between publication of the Technical Specifications and the time by which data reporting must begin, the Commission believes that Industry Members will have sufficient time to comply with the ultimate format chosen by the Plan Processor. Therefore, the Commission believes that, rather than mandating the decision regarding the format for reporting in the CAT NMS Plan, it is reasonable for the format to be determined by the Plan Processor as a component of the CAT design.</p>

          <p id="b4a5b214-d17c-43a3-ba82-66cd360438c0">One commenter requested clarification that Industry Members would only be required to report CAT Data for &#8220;active&#8221; accounts, and then offered that &#8220;active accounts would be defined as those with activity in CAT reportable securities.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz10-8" NAME="fr_pz10-8">896</a> One commenter discussed whether Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information should be &#8220;refreshed&#8221; (i.e., updated) by an Industry Member. This commenter suggested &#8220;having the functional support for a voluntary full refresh, but&#8230;eliminat[ing] the mandated requirement to provide full refreshes periodically,&#8221; and stated that, &#8220;the initial load, daily updates and standard error processing should be sufficient to maintain data integrity.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-4" NAME="fr_pz11-4">897</a> This commenter added that while eliminating the periodic refresh of the information used to identify a Customer &#8220;may slightly reduce the burden or cost on the broker-dealer community as well as the Plan Processor, it would eliminate the need for unneeded transmission and handling of sensitive PII data.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-5" NAME="fr_pz11-5">898</a></p>
          <p id="91ea7aaa-7da6-4901-9416-44d4768f95c5">Another commenter noted the different data elements that identify a Customer under the Customer Information Approach and recommended that &#8220;customer information fields be categorized based on degree of importance for market surveillance and market reconstruction, so that focus can be concentrated on ensuring accuracy of the most important fields from a surveillance viewpoint.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-6" NAME="fr_pz11-6">899</a> This commenter added that &#8220;[d]ifferent criteria could be established based on the customer data categorization for correction turn-around time; e.g., customer unique identifier (LTID or social security number) would be of highest priority; zip code may be of lesser importance and not impact regulators&#8217; ability to surveil the marketplace.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-7" NAME="fr_pz11-7">900</a> This commenter requested clarification whether only &#8220;active&#8221; accounts are required to report customer identifying information as part of the customer definition process.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-8" NAME="fr_pz11-8">901</a></p>
          <p id="24b2bb39-62bc-4563-909f-762e8d3c81c2">One commenter opposed the Customer Information Approach. This commenter stated that the Commission should require &#8220;a universal customer ID to aid in the accuracy, integrity, and consolidation of CAT Data&#8221; and that &#8220;[f]irm-based IDs will significantly increase the complexity and fragmentation of the dataset, slowing down consolidation.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz12-3" NAME="fr_pz12-3">902</a></p>
          <p id="a2f2442d-fd94-4cab-9d92-6e4c465f692f">According to the Participants, the Customer Information Approach would not have an adverse effect on the various ways in which, and purposes for which, regulators would use, access, and analyze the audit trail data reported under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> nor would it compromise the linking of order events, alter the time and method by which regulators may access the data, or limit the use of the CAT audit trail data. The Participants noted the unique nature of the existing identifiers to be used under the Customer Information Approach, which would allow the Plan Processor to create customer linkages with the same level of accuracy as the Customer-ID. The Participants also stated that the reliability and accuracy of the data reported to the Central Repository under the Customer Information Approach is the same as under the approach outlined in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> with regard to Customer-IDs because the identifiers used under the proposed Customer Information Approach are also unique identifiers. In some cases, the Participants stated that the Customer Information Approach may result in more accurate data, as errors may be minimized because broker-dealers will not have to adjust their systems to capture and maintain the additional Customer-ID data element, and only a single entity will have to perform the mapping of firm-designated account information to Customer-ID. The Participants also noted that a universal identifier that is tied to personally identifiable information could create a substantial risk of misuse and of possible identify theft as the universal identifiers are passed between the Plan Processor and each CAT Reporter.</p>
          <p id="73d91e34-f37e-4c3a-9a46-f896dbe6adcb">The Participants further argued that the benefits of the Customer Information Approach outweigh any potential disadvantages.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-3" NAME="fr_pz13-3">903</a> The Participants added that based upon their analysis of this issue and discussions with the industry, as detailed in the Exemptive Request Letter and the Plan, the Participants disagree that the Customer Information Approach will increase complexity or slow down consolidation. The Participants stated that utilizing a single Customer-ID within the CAT while allowing firms to report using existing identifiers would substantially reduce costs and speed implementation without limiting the regulatory use of the data. Indeed, the Participants noted that the additional cost required to comply with the Customer-ID approach set forth in the Rule, rather than with the Customer Information Approach as proposed in the CAT NMS Plan, would be at least $195 million for the largest CAT Reporters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-4" NAME="fr_pz13-4">904</a></p>
          <p id="c5b0e496-5f99-4359-9e9b-6221d53f6d54">The Participants clarified in their response at what point Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information must be reported under the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-5" NAME="fr_pz13-5">905</a> The Participants stated that the approach discussed in the Exemptive Request Letter was intended to require CAT Reporters to supply Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information as part of the customer definition process&#8212;that is, prior to the origination or original receipt of an order&#8212;rather than as information submitted with each order. The Participants noted that <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4(d)(iv) of the Plan</a> describes this customer definition process, which includes the process for submitting customer information and for assigning Customer-IDs for use within the CAT. According to the Participants, the operation of <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Recording and Reporting by Participants">Sections 6.3(d)(i)</a> and <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">6.4(d)(i) of the Plan</a> clarify that a CAT Reporter is required to submit the Firm Designated IDs with the new order reports, but not the information to identify a Customer. The Participants recognized, however, that the language in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4(d)(ii)(C) of the Plan</a> could be read to suggest that the customer identifying information must be provided with each new order report (i.e., that the Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information must be submitted contemporaneously with each order, rather than submitting such information pursuant to the customer definition process). The Participants proposed that the CAT NMS Plan be amended to make clear that customer information would be submitted pursuant to the customer definition process rather than with each original receipt or origination of an order.</p>
          <p id="73acaba3-1638-4626-8efc-cb274d6bd7a8">The Participants also noted that they do not believe that trading activity thresholds with respect to identifiers would be consistent with the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz14-5" NAME="fr_pz14-5">906</a> The Participants stated that the use of unique IDs is essential to the effectiveness and usefulness of the CAT because these data elements will help regulatory users conduct surveillance across market centers and identify activity originating from multiple market participants.</p>
          <p id="3bf1f13c-b5da-4f36-9128-149ff443341d">In their response, the Participants stated that they have not yet determined how &#8220;account type&#8221; and &#8220;customer type&#8221; will be defined for purposes of reporting to the Central Repository and anticipate that they will be defined in the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz14-6" NAME="fr_pz14-6">907</a></p>
          <p id="7e399735-0726-4f0f-b592-dd0c03e029e6">With respect to limiting the reporting of a Customer&#8217;s &#8220;role in the account&#8221; on a going-forward basis (i.e., after implementation of the CAT), the Participants stated that the Plan does not distinguish between legacy and new accounts with regard to this requirement and the Participants do not believe that this change is necessary.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz14-7" NAME="fr_pz14-7">908</a></p>
          <p id="5b086c56-6635-48ec-85d0-aac886391456">The Participants stated in their response that the CAT NMS Plan currently anticipates that Industry Member CAT Reporters would only report information to identify a customer for &#8220;active accounts&#8221; as part of the customer definition process.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz15-3" NAME="fr_pz15-3">909</a> Specifically, the Plan states that &#8220;broker-dealers will initially submit full account lists for all active accounts to the Plan Processor and subsequently submit updates and changes on a daily basis,&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz15-4" NAME="fr_pz15-4">910</a> and defines &#8220;active accounts&#8221; as &#8220;accounts that have had activity within the last six months.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A6vV" NAME="fr_A6vV">911</a> Moreover, the Participants noted that the Plan states that &#8220;[t]he Participants anticipate that Customer information that is initially reported to the CAT could be limited to only customer accounts that have, or are expected to have, CAT-reportable activity. For example, accounts that are considered open, but have not traded Eligible Securities in a given timeframe may not need to be pre-established in the CAT, but rather could be reported as part of daily updates after they have CAT-reportable activity.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AFPQ" NAME="fr_AFPQ">912</a> Accordingly, the Participants suggested that the CAT NMS Plan be amended to clarify that only active accounts are required to report Customer Identifying Information during the customer definition process.</p>
          <p id="dd0a5c47-229c-4d42-9649-8fbbf9e5b6ee">With respect to the Plan&#8217;s requirement to periodically refresh Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information, the Participants stated in their response that they believe that maintaining the accuracy of customer information is vital to the operation of the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AbEy" NAME="fr_AbEy">913</a> Therefore, the Participants noted that a periodic refresh of customer information is beneficial because it will help to ensure that all customer information remains accurate and up to date. The Participants further acknowledged the concern with maintaining the confidentiality of PII and other CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-3" NAME="fr_pz16-3">914</a> To that end, the Participants highlighted <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Information Security Program">Section 6.12 of the Plan</a>, which requires the Plan Processor to develop and maintain a comprehensive information security program that meets certain requirements set forth in the Plan, and the fact that the information security program must be approved and reviewed at least annually by the Operating Committee. The Participants stated that they continue to assess the Bidders&#8217; proposed security solutions and believe that once the CAT is operational the information security program will address the commenters&#8217; concerns regarding data security. Finally, the Participants noted that the Plan will define the scope of a &#8220;full&#8221; customer information refresh and the extent to which inactive or other accounts would need to be reported.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-4" NAME="fr_pz16-4">915</a></p>
          <p id="ea402f5a-5fd2-4964-9d8b-921723f71b8f">The Participants further stated that they do not agree that it would be appropriate to rank the importance of particular data elements reported to the Central Repository for data correction or other purposes for several reasons.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-5" NAME="fr_pz16-5">916</a> First, the Participants pointed out that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> does not indicate that any data elements are more or less important for market surveillance or market reconstruction purposes. The Participants noted that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(c)(7)</a> states that the Plan &#8220;shall require each national securities exchange, national securities association, and any member of such exchange or association to record and electronically report to the central repository details for each order and each reportable event, including, but not limited to [the information set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(c)(7)(i)</a>&#8211;(viii)]&#8221; (emphasis added). Second, the Participants noted that ranking the importance of data elements for market surveillance and market reconstruction purposes might inappropriately reveal the confidential, proprietary surveillance processes used by each Participant. Third, the Participants stated that with respect to data accuracy, the Participants have included provisions in the Plan to take into account minor and major inconsistencies in Customer information. In particular, the Participants noted that Appendix D explains that &#8220;[t]he Plan Processor must design and implement procedures and mechanisms to handle both minor and material inconsistencies in Customer information.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-3" NAME="fr_pz17-3">917</a> Additionally, material inconsistencies must be communicated to the submitting CAT Reporter(s) and resolved within the established error correction timeframe, as detailed in Sections 6&#8211;7 of Appendix D of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-4" NAME="fr_pz17-4">918</a> The Participants stated that the Central Repository also must have an audit trail showing the resolution of all errors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-5" NAME="fr_pz17-5">919</a> Finally, the Participants noted that they intend to monitor errors in the customer information fields and will consider, as appropriate, whether to prioritize the correction of certain data fields over others.</p>
          <p id="6bae2f3b-8453-4f6d-a178-b7310d47e79b">The Commission believes that the clarification provided by the Participants that Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information are reported as part of the customer definition process, rather than with each original receipt or origination of an order, is reasonable. The Commission believes that this will clarify the process for submitting information to identify a Customer under the CAT NMS Plan and will remove any ambiguity as to the reporting responsibilities of Industry Members. The Commission further believes that this clarification also will reduce the prospect of unnecessarily passing sensitive customer PII data. Accordingly, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4(d)(ii)(C) of the CAT NMS Plan</a> to clarify that Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information will be reported as part of the Customer definition process, rather than upon original receipt or origination of an order.</p>
          <p id="94b71743-2576-448d-838b-41643d9b85de">The Commission also agrees that creating a unique Customer-ID as contemplated by the CAT NMS Plan, regardless of the Customer&#8217;s trading activity threshold, is reasonable. The Commission notes that surveillance and enforcement efforts are necessary, even for accounts with low levels of trading activity.</p>
          <p id="6aab586d-3730-48f4-8337-88771fa5f6cb">The Commission further believes that it is reasonable to allow the Plan Processor, in conjunction with the Operating Committee, to define the specific &#8220;account types&#8221; and &#8220;customer types&#8221; in the Technical Specifications for the CAT NMS Plan. This approach will allow the Plan Processor to assess the various definitions of &#8220;account type&#8221; and &#8220;customer type&#8221; that exist among the CAT Reporters, and then make a determination as to how to appropriately classify them for purposes of CAT reporting. The Commission expects the Plan Processor will define these terms with sufficient precision so that the reporting requirements will be clear.</p>
          <p id="ca8ec25e-be8d-4ee8-83fb-a4053b83573f">The Commission agrees that a Customer&#8217;s role in the account should be a data element that is reported as part of the customer definition process, regardless of whether the account existed prior to implementation of the CAT or was created thereafter. The CAT NMS Plan does not distinguish between legacy and new accounts, for purposes of reporting Customer Identifying Information, and the Commission believes identifying the Customer&#8217;s role in the account will facilitate surveillance and enforcement efforts.</p>
          <p id="f24676dc-31ec-4b62-ab1c-c13a751f26cb">The Commission also believes that it is reasonable to limit the reporting of Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information to only those accounts that are &#8220;active,&#8221; defined as a Customer account that has had activity (i.e., received or originated an order), in an Eligible Security within the last six months. This will alleviate the need for CAT Reporters to update the Customer Identifying Information or Customer Account Information for accounts that have not received or originated an order for more than six months, but still ensures that the Central Repository will collect audit trail data for Customer accounts that have any Reportable Events. The Commission notes that pursuant to the Plan and the Customer Information Approach, a CAT Reporter must upload any Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information to the Central Repository prior to a Customer originating an order. Because of this requirement, even if a CAT Reporter has not been updating the Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information for a Customer with an account with no Reportable Events for six months, if the Customer decides to submit or originate an order, the CAT Reporter would upload the required information identifying the Customer on the same day the Customer submits the order, and upon submission of the order, the Central Repository will collect the audit trail data required by <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4 of the Plan</a>. Accordingly, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article I - Definitions, Definitions">Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan</a> to add a definition of &#8220;Active Accounts&#8221; to mean an account that has received or originated an order in an Eligible Security within the last six months. In addition, the Commission will amend <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4(d)(iv) of the Plan</a> to require that Industry Members submit an initial set of Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information to the Central Repository only for Active Accounts; and require Industry Members to update Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information only for Active Accounts.</p>
          <p id="6e3a4cf2-8b88-4bc0-bbe3-4a882869b7d1">The Commission also believes that it is reasonable for the CAT NMS Plan to require the periodic refresh of such information to ensure that the Central Repository has the most current information identifying a Customer. The Commission notes that both daily updates and periodic refreshes will require the uploading of PII, along with other CAT Data, to the Central Repository, but believes that the robust information security program to be implemented and maintained by the Plan Processor should sufficiently protect all CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-5" NAME="fr_pz20-5">920</a></p>

Accordingly, the Commission is amending the definition of &#8220;Customer Identifying Information&#8221; in Section 1.1 of the Plan to require that an Industry Member report an LEI to identify a Customer that is a legal entity, if the Industry Member has or acquires the LEI of such Customer. However, the Commission is also making clear that the LEI is not reported in lieu of the other Customer Identifying Information for a legal entity (e.g., name, address, or employer identification number), but must be reported along with other Customer Identifying Information.</p>

Specifically, the amendment to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Recording and Reporting by Participants">Section 6.3(e)(i)</a> would require a Participant (i) for purposes of reporting information to identify itself pursuant to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Recording and Reporting by Participants">Section 6.3(e)(i)</a>, to submit its LEI to the Central Repository, if the Participant has an LEI; and (ii) for purposes of reporting information to identify an Industry Member pursuant to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Recording and Reporting by Participants">Section 6.3(e)(i)</a>, to submit the CRD number for the Industry Member, as well as the LEI of the Industry Member if the Participant has collected such LEI of the Industry Member. The amendment to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4(d)(vi)</a> with respect to Industry Members would require an Industry Member, for purposes of reporting information to identify itself pursuant to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Data Reporting and Recording by Industry Members">Section 6.4(d)(vi)</a>, to submit to the Central Repository the CRD number of the Industry Member as well as the LEI of the Industry Member (if the Industry Member has an LEI).</p>

The use of Allocation Reports will provide the Central Repository the ability to efficiently, accurately, and reliably link the subaccount holder to those with authority to trade on behalf of the account, which will ultimately improve regulatory efforts by SROs and the Commission, including market surveillance, market reconstructions, enforcement investigations, and examinations of market participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-6" NAME="fr_pz40-6">999</a> Additionally, by leveraging existing broker-dealer processes, the Plan&#8217;s Allocation Report Approach could potentially reduce the time CAT Reporters need to comply with CAT reporting requirements and lower costs by using existing business processes.</p>

          <p id="14f144d5-e1af-494b-be26-27873d718cf6">In response, the Participants stated that allocation timestamps would &#8220;be a significant tool for detecting regulatory issues associated with allocations, including allocation fraud,&#8221; and supported requiring them in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-3" NAME="fr_pz42-3">1007</a> However, the Participants stated that the cost of changes that would be necessary to capture timestamps to the millisecond may not be justified, particularly in light of the fact that allocations tend to be a manual process.

          <p id="d680470b-9c52-4183-9d6b-5b94921112e2">The Commission agrees with the Participants that inclusion of the time of an allocation as part of the data submitted in the Allocation Report is reasonable to help detect abuse that may occur if executions are allocated among subaccounts at the same time. For example, the Commission believes that the time of allocation will assist regulators in assessing regulatory issues that might arise in the allocation process, such as &#8220;cherry-picking&#8221; (systematically favoring one customer over another in connection with specific allocation decisions).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-5" NAME="fr_pz42-5">1009</a> Currently, investigations of potential cherry-picking require a manual, data-intensive process.

          <p id="fbd61f9b-2a21-499e-8b1b-3f2df4cb63f4">With regard to the appropriate level of granularity for the timestamps on Allocation Reports, the Commission agrees with the Participants that, given the manual nature of the allocation process, a timestamp granularity of one second is appropriate and would not reduce the regulatory value of the information. The Commission also believes that the clock synchronization standard for Business Clocks that capture the time of an allocation need only be to the second. This approach is consistent with the approach for Manual Order Events. The Commission does not believe that the regulatory benefit of requiring allocation times to be recorded in milliseconds (compared to seconds) and clock synchronization to 50 milliseconds (compared to one second) justifies the costs at this time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-8" NAME="fr_pz43-8">1011</a></p>

          <p id="8f58f953-0e5d-4047-ad0e-0bcc475b2aae">In their response, the Participants disagreed that requiring only the Options Exchanges to report market maker quotations to the Central Repository would be detrimental to the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz46-9" NAME="fr_pz46-9">1027</a> The Participants noted that all data that would otherwise be reported by Options Market Makers will still be reported, including Quote Sent Time.

          <p id="da327b6e-705f-4d8a-8700-2b9a20cfd124">With regard to the commenter that suggested equities market maker quotes should be handled in the same manner as Options Market Maker quotes, the Participants explained that they focused on Options Market Makers because of the significant volume of quotes they produce.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-3" NAME="fr_pz47-3">1029</a> The Participants stated that the volume of equities market maker quotes is much smaller than the volume of options market maker quotes, noting that there are far fewer quote updates for every trade in the equities markets, with an approximate average ratio of quotes to trades of 18 to 1 in the equities markets as compared to ratio of 8,634 to 1 for options.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-4" NAME="fr_pz47-4">1030</a></p>
          <p id="f85f4546-3bff-4212-bbbe-6b371d81743f">The Commission believes the proposed approach is reasonable in providing the same regulatory benefits as would be achieved under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, at a reduced cost and implementation burden on CAT Reporters. The Commission notes that the information that Options Market Makers report to Options Exchanges must be reported to the Central Repository without change, and the information that regulators would receive if Options Market Makers reported their quotation information to the Central Repository would be identical to the information that they will receive under the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, there will be no degradation to the audit trail. The Commission disagrees with the comment that signals for market surveillance and manipulation detection purposes could be distorted if Options Market Makers are not required to report their quotation information<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-5" NAME="fr_pz47-5">1031</a> because the exact information that the Options Market Makers would report to the CAT will be reported on their behalf by the Options Exchanges. The Commission acknowledges the commenter who recommended that equity market makers also be exempt from reporting their quotes to the CAT, but does not believe that it is appropriate at this time to grant such an exemption. As noted above, equity market makers produce significantly fewer quotes that Options Market Makers, and the Commission has not been presented with evidence that reporting equity market maker quotes is unduly burdensome.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-5" NAME="fr_pz48-5">1032</a></p>

          <p id="6b907503-3d22-41f8-9fe2-fb47519814b1">One commenter recommended a re-examination of the data elements to be collected in the CAT NMS Plan, and questioned whether a &#8220;more broad and complete audit trail&#8221; is needed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-6" NAME="fr_pz48-6">1033</a> This commenter recommended that the CAT include data on the settlement of securities transactions (i.e., post-execution) from the DTCC and NSCC, short sale information, including lending/borrowing information and pre-execution short sale locate data, and creation/redemption information for Exchange Traded Funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-7" NAME="fr_pz48-7">1034</a></p>
          <p id="d7c25faf-65eb-4e3e-986a-e1071f0a4fde">In response to the commenter, the Participants described how the CAT NMS Plan aligns with the scope of required elements in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. The Participants generally expressed their view that the potential benefit of requiring additional elements, such as settlement information, lending/borrowing information, short sale locate data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-8" NAME="fr_pz48-8">1035</a> and ETF creation/redemption data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-9" NAME="fr_pz48-9">1036</a> would be outweighed by the design and implementation costs at this time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-4" NAME="fr_pz49-4">1037</a> The Participants committed generally to assess whether additional information should be reported to the CAT in the future.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-5" NAME="fr_pz49-5">1038</a></p>
          <p id="90c40d16-4d9c-4394-aeed-1605ea461b29">The Commission notes that, with regard to a locate identifier on short sales, data could be readily obtained from a follow-up request to a broker-dealer if the other data required to be reported to the CAT, particularly the information relating to the customer behind the order, is included in the consolidated audit trail. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-6" NAME="fr_pz49-6">1039</a> With regard to lending/borrowing information, the Commission understands that some of this data can be obtained through private sources, such as service providers. The Participants stated that they do not believe that the benefits of including this information in the CAT justify the costs for requiring them to be reported. The Commission similarly believes that it is not necessary to require this information in CAT. With regard to the inclusion of information on ETF creations and redemptions, the Commission agrees with the Participants that the relevant market participants may not be included in the current scope of CAT Reporters. Therefore, the Commission is not amending the Plan to include these data elements in the CAT at this time. Nor is it amending the Plan to include information on the settlement of securities transactions from DTCC and NSCC in the CAT, as it would require participation by entities not currently party to the CAT NMS Plan, and the regulatory benefits to the Participants and the Commission would not, at this time, justify the costs.</p>
          <p id="549124dd-30dc-4244-b03d-f4ff66fea923">The Commission appreciates the commenter&#8217;s perspective that additional data elements may offer some regulatory benefit. However, neither <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> nor the CAT NMS Plan proposed including such data elements. After considering the comments, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to not mandate the reporting of new data elements to the CAT at this time. The Commission does not believe that the benefits to the Commission and Participants justify the cost for requiring additional data elements to be reported. The Commission or the Participants may consider additional data elements in the future.</p>

          <p id="33ba10fe-b071-4032-898c-25add3897536">The Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s requirement that CAT Reporters report data using the listing exchange&#8217;s symbol is reasonable. The Commission agrees with the Participants that allowing each CAT Reporter to determine its reporting symbology would impose burdens on, and add complexity for, the Plan Processor by requiring each CAT Reporter to regularly submit to the Plan Processor symbology mappings. Additionally, the Commission believes that using existing symbology may reduce errors, as noted by the Participants. The Commission also understands, based on the Participants&#8217; representations, that CAT Reporters that report to OATS and EBS today already have the ability to translate to the listing exchange&#8217;s symbology.</p>

However, the Commission expects that the Participants will require the Plan Processor to continuously monitor the information security program of the CAT to ensure that it is consistent with the highest industry standards for the protection of data, and to proactively implement appropriate changes to the security program to guard against any unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the Plan Processor&#8217;s data security protocols and protections. The Commission also expects that, when the Plan Processor is chosen, the Plan Processor will provide more detail about the specific security requirements and attendant obligations placed on the Participants, including through the issuance of Technical Specifications, which will be publicly available; more explicit language indicating requirements for overall security of data transmission and storage; more granularity related to actual controls and service levels; and more details about the technical support that will be implemented by the Plan Processor. The Commission also notes that, as discussed in Section IV.H, the Commission is amending Section 6.6 of the Plan to require that the Participants provide the Commission with an annual evaluation of the information security program to ensure that the program is consistent with the highest industry standards for the protection of data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-3" NAME="fr_pz59-3">1077</a></p>

          <p id="3d991343-d593-4545-b07c-9753fdd1601b">In response to specific commenters that believed that only individuals with appropriate training should be permitted access to CAT Data, <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Plan Processor">Section 6.1(m) of the Plan</a> states that &#8220;[t]he Plan Processor shall develop and, with the prior approval of the Operating Committee, implement a training program, which will be made available to all individuals who have access to the Central Repository on behalf of the Participants or the SEC prior to such individuals being granted access to the Central Repository, that addresses the security and confidentiality of all information accessible from the CAT, as well as the operational risks associated with accessing the Central Repository.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz69-3" NAME="fr_pz69-3">1115</a> Appendix D of the Plan also states that the Plan Processor must provide to the Operating Committee a comprehensive security plan that covers all components of the CAT System, including physical assets and personnel, and the training of all persons who have access to the Central Repository consistent with <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Plan Processor">Article VI, Section 6.1(m)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz69-4" NAME="fr_pz69-4">1116</a> Thus, the Commission believes that these Plan provisions, taken together, indicate that the Plan Processor will require that all persons that have access to CAT Data will be required to complete training prior to accessing CAT Data, and expects that only those persons that have been adequately trained will have access to CAT Data.</p>
          <p id="09368044-f45f-4421-8546-a7e468e641a5">In response to the commenter that stated that persons authorized to access CAT Data should have comprehensive background checks, the Commission notes that the Plan provides that &#8220;in addition to other policies, procedures and standards generally applicable to the Plan Processor&#8217;s employees and contractors, the Plan Processor shall have hiring standards and shall conduct and enforce background checks (e.g., fingerprint-based) for all of its employees and contractors to ensure the protection, safeguarding and security of the facilities, systems, networks, equipment and data of the CAT System. . . .&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz69-5" NAME="fr_pz69-5">1117</a> While the Commission believes that this provision sets out a reasonable approach to background checks for employees and contractors of the Plan Processor, the Commission believes that such a requirement generally should extend to Participants with respect to all of their users that have access to CAT Data and therefore is amending the Plan to require that each Participant conduct background checks for its employees and contractors that will use the CAT System.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-4" NAME="fr_pz70-4">1118</a> The Commission believes that this amendment to the Plan is appropriate in order to ensure that only authorized and qualified persons are using the CAT System.</p>
          <p id="9cde150b-889c-45c6-9004-d58d2efb5b87">The Commission also notes that the Participants have represented that all logins must be secured by MFA, in response to commenters concerns that authentication procedures for CAT users should ensure that only credentialed persons are accessing the CAT Data. In addition, in response to commenters that expressed concerns about the password authentication procedures of the Plan Processor, the Commission notes that the Plan addresses password guidelines such as, for example, the appropriate complexity of passwords and the recovery of lost passwords.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-5" NAME="fr_pz70-5">1119</a> The Commission also believes that the Plan does not prohibit the Plan Processor from considering an approach to authenticating a CAT user that would leverage the authentication procedures at the entity (either a Participant or CAT Reporter) that employs a person seeking access to CAT Data, as suggested by a commenter. The Commission believes these provisions, taken together, provide reasonable protections around CAT user administration.</p>
          <p id="f5f1a5b7-18d7-4ea6-8345-42c65a5ca8c9">Finally, with respect to another aspect of CAT user access administration, in their response the Participants noted that they do not believe that memoranda of understanding or similar agreements between the CAT LLC and the Participants are necessary since the Participants will be bound by both their participation in the Plan as well as the agreement between the CAT LLC and the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-6" NAME="fr_pz70-6">1120</a> However, the Participants stated they believe that it is important that information regarding CAT Data usage, such as contact points and escalation procedures, be shared between the Plan Processor and the Participants; therefore, the Participants state they expect to establish such information sharing agreements between the Plan Processor and the Participants once the Plan Processor is chosen. Moreover, the Participants stated, they expect that one of the CISO&#8217;s responsibilities would be to make sure that this information is captured and kept up to date appropriately.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-4" NAME="fr_pz71-4">1121</a></p>
          <p id="41ca19fc-0dce-4f15-9a7b-9c7985f4b90b">The Commission notes that the Plan Processor has not yet been chosen and thus the execution of such memoranda is not appropriate at this time. However, the Commission believes that explicitly memorializing issues relating to CAT Data usage between the Plan Processor and each Participant would be beneficial to the operation of the CAT System.</p>
          <p id="9874a9b7-5107-441c-b6e5-f75ef1006fff">The Commission also notes that, with respect to access, the CAT NMS Plan provides that the Plan Processor will provide to the Participants and the Commission access to the Representatives of the Plan Processor as any Participant or the Commission may reasonably request solely for the purpose of performing such Person&#8217;s regulatory and oversight responsibilities pursuant to the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations or any contractual obligations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-5" NAME="fr_pz71-5">1122</a> The Plan also provides that the Plan Processor will direct its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with any inquiry, investigation, or proceeding conducted by or on behalf of any Participant or the Commission related to such purpose.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-6" NAME="fr_pz71-6">1123</a> As filed, this provision would allow the Plan Processor to refuse access to the Commission and/or Participants upon its own determination of &#8220;unreasonableness.&#8221; The Commission believes that Commission or Participant requests for access to Representatives of the Plan Processor should be considered reasonable, absent other circumstances. It is therefore amending the Plan to delete the requirement that the access to Plan Processor Representatives be &#8220;reasonable&#8221; and that the Representatives of the Plan Processor only be required to &#8220;reasonably&#8221; cooperate with any inquiry, investigation, or proceeding conducted by or on behalf of the Commission. The Commission expects that, even without the &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; qualifier, it and the Participants will be reasonable in requesting access to the Representatives of the Plan Processor.</p>

        <p id="7f63716f-4e88-417c-b6a7-b1fc9e7713df">The Commission believes that ensuring the security and confidentiality of CAT Data is of utmost importance, and also notes the Participants&#8217; recognition that regulators should have flexibility in designing such surveillance systems, including the ability to access and transfer data where necessary and consistent with appropriate data security safeguards. As described above, the Plan Processor has the specific responsibility to develop and implement policies, procedures and control structures related to the security of the CAT System.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-4" NAME="fr_pz2-4">1149</a> The Plan Processor also is responsible for the security and confidentiality of all CAT Data received and reported to the Central Repository, including during all communications between CAT Reporters and the Plan Processor, data extraction, data manipulation and transformation, loading to and from the Central Repository, and data maintenance and storage by the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-5" NAME="fr_pz2-5">1150</a> The Plan Processor also must require the establishment of secure controls for data retrieval and query reports for CAT Data reported to and stored in the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAf-" NAME="fr_pAf-">1151</a></p>
        <p id="35fff714-14bc-4d21-91a4-9167ba43baa3">While the Plan Processor is responsible for the security of the CAT Data collected by and stored in the Central Repository, the Commission agrees with commenters that once CAT Data is extracted into a Participant&#8217;s regulatory surveillance system, the Plan Processor can no longer assure the security of the CAT Data because the details, requirements and rigor of the policies and procedures regarding the security of CAT Data at each Participant are beyond the direct control of the Plan Processor. This is the case whether the CAT Data is downloaded to a Participant&#8217;s local server, or downloaded into a dedicated sandbox within the CAT cloud &#8211; and whether the CAT Data that is downloaded is a subset of all the CAT Data collected by the Central Repository, or the entirety of the CAT Data (i.e., cloning the entire CAT database).</p>
        <p id="ffddaef9-dcda-4cf5-86b6-4ffd7b5da0dd">Therefore, the Commission believes that if a Participant chooses to extract CAT Data, whether into its own local server environment or into its own sandbox within the CAT cloud, the Participant must have policies and procedures regarding CAT Data security that are comparable to those implemented and maintained by the Plan Processor for the Central Repository, and that each Participant must certify and provide evidence to the CISO that its policies and procedures for the security of CAT Data meet the same security standards applicable to the CAT Data that is reported to, and collected and stored by, the Central Repository. Given the necessity of ensuring the security of CAT Data that is collected by and stored in the Central Repository, the Commission believes that this is a reasonable requirement that will ensure that CAT Data is subject to the same standards of security, whether the CAT Data is downloaded by a Participant onto the Participant&#8217;s local servers, or downloaded into the Participant&#8217;s sandbox within the CAT cloud,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-3" NAME="fr_pz3-3">1152</a> and therefore, is amending the plan accordingly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-4" NAME="fr_pz3-4">1153</a></p>

The Commission further believes that if the CISO, in consultation with the CCO, finds that any such information security policies and procedures of a Participant are not comparable to the policies and procedures applicable to the CAT System, and the issue is not promptly addressed by the applicable Participant, the CISO, in consultation with the CCO, will be required to provide notice of any such deficiency to the Operating Committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAtf" NAME="fr_pAtf">1154</a></p>

        <p id="38bf8638-3186-4a3c-b0a9-f2ebbc6f270e">In response to commenters, the Participants stated that they continue to believe that it is appropriate for the CAT NMS Plan to permit the Participants to use their Raw Data for commercial or other purposes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz22-5" NAME="fr_pz22-5">1232</a> Therefore, the Participants do not propose to prohibit such use.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz22-6" NAME="fr_pz22-6">1233</a> Nevertheless, to address the concern raised by a commenter that the CAT NMS Plan inconsistently uses the terms &#8220;Raw Data&#8221; and &#8220;CAT Data&#8221; in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Sections 6.5(f)(i)(A)</a> <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(h) of the CAT NMS Plan</a>, the Participants recommended that the term &#8220;Raw Data&#8221; replace the term &#8220;CAT Data&#8221; in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(i)(A) of the Plan</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz22-7" NAME="fr_pz22-7">1234</a></p>
        <p id="181aed94-727f-4681-bad1-a62f115e0b4b">As an initial matter, the Commission finds that it is reasonable to amend the Plan to replace the term &#8220;CAT Data&#8221; with &#8220;Raw Data&#8221; in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(i)(A) of the Plan</a>, to remove any inconsistency and potential confusion. The Commission also finds that the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s provisions regarding the use of Raw Data by a Participant is a reasonable approach to the use of audit trail data that is reported by the Participant itself. In response to the commenter&#8217;s request that the Commission define the circumstances under which a Participant cannot use its Raw Data, the Commission finds that the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s provision that the use must not be prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation is sufficient guidance to Participants regarding their use of the Raw Data used for commercial or other purposes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz22-8" NAME="fr_pz22-8">1235</a> Similarly, the Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s definition of &#8220;Raw Data&#8221; is sufficiently clear and further addresses the comments that the Participants may expand the audit trail data that Participants may use for commercial or other purposes. The Commission notes that the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s definition of &#8220;Raw Data&#8221; limits such data to &#8220;Participant Data&#8221; or &#8220;Industry Member Data.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz23-6" NAME="fr_pz23-6">1236</a> In this regard, in response to the commenter with concerns about a Participant commercializing customer identifying information, the Commission notes that a Participant would never be in a position to report customer identifying information itself; therefore, a Participant could not use customer identifying information for commercial or other purposes. The Commission also believes that, pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan, the Participants may not use CAT Data for commercial purposes.</p>

        <p id="68df043d-5250-4b06-8b71-3fe0af3a549b">A few commenters discussed whether Industry Members should be permitted access to their own reported audit trail data through bulk data exports. One commenter stated that it &#8220;would be highly beneficial for CAT Reporters to have access to their own data&#8221; to assist with error identification and correction, and stressed the importance of building such access into CAT as part of the initial design, even if CAT Reporters were not permitted such access during the initial phase of CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-5" NAME="fr_pz24-5">1239</a> To address security concerns, the commenter suggested that retrieval of PII data should be limited to a set of CAT Reporter personnel who are responsible for entering and correcting customer information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-6" NAME="fr_pz24-6">1240</a> Another commenter noted that broker-dealers should be permitted to access, export and use their data within the Central Repository at no charge and that &#8220;[a]llowing broker-dealers to access their own data will be beneficial for surveillance and internal compliance programs and may incentivize firms to make other internal improvements including, among other things, reducing potential errors.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-7" NAME="fr_pz24-7">1241</a> This commenter also argued that broker-dealers should not be subject to additional fees to simply retrieve data they already submitted to the CAT, noting that CAT is the only broker-dealer regulatory reporting service for which the SROs have proposed to impose system-specific fees on broker-dealers.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-3" NAME="fr_pz25-3">1242</a> Another commenter stated that &#8220;[a]llowing CAT Reporters to access their own data would be beneficial for surveillance and internal compliance programs. If data access is considered as part of the initial design of the Central Repository, we believe the benefits outweigh the cost.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-4" NAME="fr_pz25-4">1243</a> One commenter argued that independent software vendors also should have fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory access, at their client&#8217;s request, to the data submitted or stored at the Central Repository on their client&#8217;s behalf.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-5" NAME="fr_pz25-5">1244</a> In support, this commenter noted that OATS permitted access to determine reporting accuracy by &#8220;matching in both directions,&#8221; so that reporters could address matching errors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-6" NAME="fr_pz25-6">1245</a></p>
        <p id="8c236233-90ed-4775-a958-ef6341b8ba74">In response to these comments, the Participants noted that during the development of the Plan, the SROs considered whether to provide Industry Members with access to their own data through bulk data exports.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-7" NAME="fr_pz25-7">1246</a> Based on the data security and cost considerations, the Participants stated that they determined that such access was not a cost-effective requirement for the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-8" NAME="fr_pz25-8">1247</a> Accordingly, the CAT NMS Plan was drafted to state that &#8220;[n]on-Participant CAT Reporters will be able to view their submissions online in a read-only, non-exportable format to facilitate error identification and correction.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-9" NAME="fr_pz25-9">1248</a></p>
        <p id="a3643a4f-c007-4a22-8b94-2644bed2b7ac">In light of the comments that the Commission received and further evaluation of the issue, however, in their response, the Participants stated that they now believe that there may be merit to providing Industry Member and their vendors with bulk access to the CAT Reporters&#8217; own unlinked CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-3" NAME="fr_pz26-3">1249</a> For example, the Participants stated that such access may facilitate the CAT Reporters&#8217; error analysis and internal surveillance and that it may expedite the retirement of duplicative reporting systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-4" NAME="fr_pz26-4">1250</a> However, the Participants noted, providing bulk data access also raises a variety of operational, security, cost and other issues related to the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-5" NAME="fr_pz26-5">1251</a> The Participants stated that they would need to address this additional functionality with the Plan Processor; in addition, the Participants stated that inclusion of this functionality would create additional burdens on the CAT and the Plan Processor and, therefore, may require additional funding from CAT Reporters for such access to the CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-6" NAME="fr_pz26-6">1252</a> Therefore, the Participants stated that they will consider this issue once the CAT is operational.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pACte" NAME="fr_pACte">1253</a></p>
        <p id="2948c50b-456d-4cb2-9d24-6b339c7aa9f9">The Commission recognizes the commenters&#8217; desire for bulk access to their own data for surveillance and internal compliance purposes, as well as possible error correction purposes. The Commission also recognizes the Participants&#8217; initial approach of not permitting such access for security and cost purposes, as set forth in their response. Given the complexity of initially implementing the CAT, the Commission believes that the Participants&#8217; approach that limits Industry Members to only being able to view their submissions online in a read-only, non-exportable format to facilitate error identification and correction is a reasonable approach at the present time. The Commission notes the Participants&#8217; representation that they will consider offering bulk access to the audit trail data reported by Industry Members once CAT is operational. The Commission expects the Participants to fulfill this commitment and as part of their evaluation, the Commission expects that the Participants may consider whether a fee for such access would be appropriate and how such a fee might impact the funding of the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-3" NAME="fr_pz27-3">1254</a></p>
        <p id="ff600ddd-344a-4ee4-a98f-d0ad3ffdc22d">The Commission disagrees with the commenters that recommended providing access to CAT Data for independent software vendors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-4" NAME="fr_pz27-4">1255</a> Given the highly sensitive nature of the CAT Data, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to not allow access to parties other than the SROs and the Commission. If the Participants decide to propose granting such access after gaining experience with CAT operations, and are able to ensure the security of data, the Commission will consider, based on the analysis presented, whether granting access to CAT Reporters and other non-regulator industry members is reasonable.</p>
        <p id="9fd104b0-70d7-4769-aedd-30d9e692f24f">The Commission also notes that, as discussed in Section IV.H, the Commission is amending Section 6.6 of the Plan to require that, within 24 months of effectiveness of the Plan, the Participants provide the Commission with a report discussing the feasibility, benefits, and risks of allowing an Industry Member to bulk download the Raw Data it submitted to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-5" NAME="fr_pz27-5">1256</a></p>

        <p id="1d0c522d-d0ef-4ef4-9b73-bb8f22b77d0d">The Commission recognizes the commenter&#8217;s concerns about the lack of details in the CAT NMS Plan regarding how regulators will be able to perform their day-to-day analysis using CAT Data, in light of the Regulator Use Cases. The Commission notes, however, that in the Adopting Release the Commission stated that it was not including the Regulator Use Cases and accompanying questions to endorse a particular technology or approach to the consolidated audit trail; rather, the Regulator Use Cases and accompanying questions were designed to aid the SROs&#8217; understanding of the types of useful, specific information that the CAT NMS Plan could contain that would assist the Commission in its evaluation of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-7" NAME="fr_pz29-7">1260</a> The Commission noted that its description of Regulator Use Cases includes a non-exclusive list of factors that SROs could consider when developing the NMS plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-8" NAME="fr_pz29-8">1261</a> Thus, the Commission believes that the Regulator Use Cases were not intended to serve as a list of specific requirements regarding analytical capability or technological enhancements that should be addressed by the Participants in the CAT NMS Plan. In response to the comment that the Regulator Use Cases should be a key criteria in the selection of the Plan Processor, the Commission reiterates that the Regulator Use Cases were not intended to be used as selection criteria for the Plan but were meant to elicit the types of useful information from the bidders that would assist in the Commission in its evaluation of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

        <p id="3ee8ef3e-851f-47d4-8a39-49f7d8bd1731">Two commenters opined on these provisions. One stated that &#8220;the security of the confidential data stored in the Central Repository and other CAT systems must be of the highest quality and that no authorized users with access to CAT Data should be exempt from any provisions regarding security requirements and standards set forth in the Plan.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-3" NAME="fr_pz30-3">1264</a> Another commenter expressed concern that the Plan does not require Commission Staff to abide by the same security protocols for handling PII that other users of CAT Data are required to follow and urged the Commission to adopt these safeguards.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-4" NAME="fr_pz30-4">1265</a></p>
        <p id="e27defb5-6f32-415c-b2ba-b78cea831809">Specifically, one commenter objected to the exclusion of Commissioners and employees of the Commission from <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(i)(A) of the Plan</a>, which provides that the Plan Processor must require individuals with access to the Central Repository to use appropriate confidentiality safeguards and to use CAT Data only for surveillance and regulatory purposes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-5" NAME="fr_pz30-5">1266</a> In addition, the commenter argued that <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(g) of the Plan</a>, which requires the Participants to establish and enforce policies and procedures regarding CAT Data confidentiality, should also apply to the Commission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-6" NAME="fr_pz30-6">1267</a> Similarly, another commenter sees no reason why the Commission should not have to follow the requirements of <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(g)</a> and emphasized that the Commission needs to follow adequate policies and procedures when handling PII.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-7" NAME="fr_pz30-7">1268</a> However, the first commenter noted that it &#8220;do[es] not believe that individuals performing their employment duties should be subject to personal liability and that such liability would not reduce security risks,&#8221; and objected to <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(i)(B) of the Plan</a>, which requires the submission of a &#8220;Safeguard of Information Affidavit&#8221; providing for personal liability for misuse of data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-4" NAME="fr_pz31-4">1269</a></p>

        <p id="77596614-da8b-490a-96ec-1956616006c8">The Commission takes very seriously concerns about maintaining the security and confidentiality of CAT Data and believes that it is imperative that all CAT users, including the Commission, implement and maintain a robust security framework with appropriate safeguards to ensure that CAT Data is kept confidential and used only for surveillance and regulatory purposes. However, the Commission is not a party to the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-7" NAME="fr_pz31-7">1272</a> By statute, the Commission is the regulator of the Participants, and the Commission will oversee and enforce their compliance with the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-8" NAME="fr_pz31-8">1273</a> To impose obligations on the Commission under the Plan would invert this structure, raising questions about the Participants monitoring their own regulator&#8217;s compliance with the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-3" NAME="fr_pz32-3">1274</a> Accordingly, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate for its security and confidentiality obligations, or those of its personnel, to be reflected through Plan provisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-4" NAME="fr_pz32-4">1275</a> Rather, the obligations of the Commission and its personnel with respect to the security and confidentiality of CAT Data should be reflected through different mechanisms than those of the Participants. The Commission reiterates that in each instance the purpose of excluding Commission personnel from these provisions is not to subject the Commission or its personnel to more lenient data security or confidentiality standards. Despite these differences in the origins of their respective obligations, the rules and policies applicable to the Commission and its personnel will be comparable to those applicable to the Participants and their personnel.</p>
        <p id="40b53a9d-16e8-411a-92be-42e960b54618">The Commission and its personnel are subject to a number of existing federal and Commission rules and policies regarding the security and confidentiality of information that they encounter in the course of their employment. These rules and policies apply with equal force to data that Commission personnel can access in the CAT. For example, existing laws and regulations prohibit Commission personnel from disclosing non-public information<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-5" NAME="fr_pz32-5">1276</a> without authorization.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-2" NAME="fr_pz33-2">1277</a> CAT Data available to Commission personnel will contain non-public information. Thus, Commission personnel who disclose or otherwise misuse this data would potentially be subject to criminal penalties (including fines and imprisonment), as well as disciplinary action (including termination of employment), civil injunction, and censure by professional associations (for attorneys and accountants).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-3" NAME="fr_pz33-3">1278</a> The Commission believes that the protections described above provide as strong a deterrent against the possible misuse of CAT Data by Commission personnel as would the submission of the &#8220;Safeguard of Information Affidavit&#8221; required by <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(i)(B)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-4" NAME="fr_pz34-4">1279</a></p>
        <p id="65bdca5e-d9e7-4268-b150-d487fcc2d30a">In addition, the Commission already has robust information security policies and procedures developed in accordance with federal directives and NIST standards that prohibit the unauthorized disclosure and inappropriate use of confidential data. Moreover, the Commission will review and update, as necessary, its existing confidentiality and data use policies and procedures to account for access to the CAT, and, like the Participants, will periodically review the effectiveness of these policies and procedures and take prompt action to remedy deficiencies in such policies and procedures. Like other information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets, the Commission&#8217;s policies and procedures applicable to CAT must comply with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and the NIST standards required thereunder,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-5" NAME="fr_pz34-5">1280</a> and will be subject to audits by the SEC Office of Inspector General and the GAO.</p>
        <p id="efaee0a5-c0ec-42fc-a20a-92ce8b8d5c12">Notwithstanding the existence of these protections, in light of the scope and nature of CAT Data, the Commission recognizes the need to ensure that it has in place a comprehensive framework for CAT data security. Accordingly, a cross-divisional steering committee of senior Commission Staff is being formed to design policies and procedures regarding Commission and Commission Staff access to, use of, and protection of CAT Data. The policies and procedures will consider, but not be limited to, access controls, appropriate background checks, usage and data protection, as well as incident response. In developing these policies and procedures, the steering committee will, of necessity, take into account how the data collection and other systems are developed in connection with the creation of the CAT. The Commission will ensure that its policies and procedures impose protections upon itself and its personnel that are comparable to those required under the provisions in the Plan from which the Commission and its personnel are excluded.</p>
        <p id="11b922ad-f1af-4b22-b939-1b28c98b923b">For these reasons, the Commission does not believe that the Plan should be amended to remove the exclusion of &#8220;employees and Commissioners of the SEC&#8221; from <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(i)(A)&#8211;(B)</a> or to extend the requirements of <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(g)</a> to the Commission. Similarly, the Commission does not believe that the requirements in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(g)</a> that Participants establish and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure the confidentiality of CAT Data obtained from the Central Repository and to limit the use of such data to surveillance and regulatory purposes can or should be extended to the Commission. Moreover, the Commission is further amending the Plan, as set forth below, to remove the Commission from certain other obligations.</p>
        <p id="e92e7c00-1686-414c-812e-9a6bbffaba31">First, the Commission is amending the Plan to provide that <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(iii)</a> does not apply to the Commission or its personnel. As proposed, this provision provided that the Participants and the Commission must, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within twenty-four hours, report instances of non-compliance with policies and procedures or breaches of the security of the CAT to the CCO. The Commission received no comments on this provision. The Commission notes that, consistent with presidential directives and guidance from the OMB and the Department of Homeland Security United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (&#8220;US-CERT&#8221;), its existing incident response policies and procedures require Commission employees to promptly convey any known instances of non-compliance with data security and confidentiality policies and procedures or breaches of the security of its systems to the CISO of the Commission, and this policy will apply to any instances of non-compliance or breaches that occur with respect to the CAT. The Commission&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding the CAT will also address conveying information regarding any such incidents to the CCO when appropriate.</p>
        <p id="9224fba0-1146-48fb-8aa1-f5cf959c88e1">Second, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission is amending the Plan to clarify that <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.5(f)(iv)(B)</a> does not apply to the Commission or its personnel. As proposed, this provision stated that the Plan Processor must &#8220;require the establishment of secure controls for data retrieval and query reports by Participant regulatory Staff and the Commission.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-3" NAME="fr_pz36-3">1281</a> The Commission received no comments on this provision. The Commission will ensure that comparable controls governing data retrieval and query reports from the CAT will be included, as applicable, in its policies and procedures.</p>
        <p id="3586b9cc-d0fe-4daf-8b81-baa34cdd8794">Third, the Commission is amending the Plan to clarify that the requirement to test changes to CAT functionality in Appendix D, Section 11.3 applies only to the Participants. As proposed, this provision stated that, with respect to changes to CAT functionality and infrastructure, the Plan Processor must &#8220;[d]efine the process by which changes are to be tested by CAT Reporters and regulators.&#8221; The Commission received no comments on this provision. For the reasons discussed above, the Commission is narrowing this provision so that it is applicable only to the Participants. However, the Commission intends to take part in the testing of changes in CAT functionality or infrastructure that would affect the way Commission personnel access and use the CAT System.</p>
        <p id="4fe8e22a-536a-4b32-82ed-3bf9d91bdd97">Fourth, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission is amending the Plan to exclude the Commission and its personnel from certain CAT user access provisions in Appendix D, Sections 4.1.4 and 4.1.6 of the CAT NMS Plan. The Plan, as proposed, provided that the Plan Processor shall &#8220;implement and maintain a mechanism to confirm the identity of all individuals permitted to access the CAT Data stored in the Central Repository and maintain a record of all instances where such CAT Data was accessed.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-3" NAME="fr_pz37-3">1282</a> Specifically, Appendix D, Section 4.1.4 of the CAT NMS Plan provides: that &#8220;[p]eriodic reports detailing the current list of authorized users and the date of their most recent access must be provided to Participants, the SEC and the Operating Committee,&#8221; that the &#8220;reports of the Participants and the SEC will include only their respective list of users,&#8221; that the &#8220;Participants and the SEC must provide a response to the report confirming that the list of users is accurate,&#8221; and that the &#8220;Plan Processor must log every instance of access to Central Repository data by users.&#8221;</p>
        <p id="a7cf8e5d-c6cb-4149-bb78-ebb755c61548">In addition, the CAT NMS Plan provides that &#8220;[a] full audit trail of PII access (who accessed what data, and when) must be maintained,&#8221; that &#8220;[t]he Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer shall have access to daily PII reports that list all users who are entitled for PII access, as well as the audit trail of all PII access that has occurred for the day being reported on,&#8221; and that &#8220;[t]he chief regulatory officer, or other such designated officer or employee at each Participant and the Commission must, at least annually, review and certify that people with PII access have the appropriate level of access for their role.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-10" NAME="fr_pz38-10">1283</a></p>
        <p id="4e52bb2a-3c97-44fd-b20d-0514c5a8ac77">For the reasons discussed above, the Commission is amending the Plan to exclude the Commission from the provisions that require the Commission to &#8220;provide a response to the report confirming that the list of users is accurate&#8221; and to &#8220;review and certify that people with PII access have the appropriate level of access for their role.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAaXsQ" NAME="fr_pAaXsQ">1284</a> However, in accordance with Commission information security policies and procedures, the Commission will periodically review the appropriateness of CAT access by personnel and work with the Plan Processor to ensure the list of SEC users authorized to access CAT Data in the Central Repository is appropriate.</p>

          <p id="af609cca-9553-4a4b-8acb-570e80e38796">A number of commenters discussed the Plan Processor&#8217;s provisions to protect the PII reported to and stored in the Central Repository. Two commenters noted that PII should be held to the &#8220;highest&#8221; or &#8220;most stringent&#8221; standards of information protection.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-3" NAME="fr_pz39-3">1285</a> However, one commenter stated that &#8220;the protection and security of PII in CAT is &#8220;good enough.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-4" NAME="fr_pz39-4">1286</a> Another commenter recommended that the Plan provide further details as to how PII data will be treated and confidentiality maintained, specifically during extraction and transmission of the data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-5" NAME="fr_pz39-5">1287</a></p>
          <p id="bdc6b2cb-17e2-42b3-a003-e733ccc0730e">Commenters also discussed the Plan&#8217;s provisions regarding access to PII. One commenter noted that &#8220;access to PII data should be provided only in the rarest of instances (i.e., SEC investigations for securities law violations), as regulators and other authorized users should be able to perform the majority, if not all, of their regulatory and oversight responsibilities by utilizing non-PII data, such as the CAT Customer-ID.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-6" NAME="fr_pz39-6">1288</a> Another commenter stated that there should be controls, policies and procedures to prohibit the downloading of certain sensitive information, such as PII, and suggested limiting Participant access to sensitive data only to specific enforcement actions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-7" NAME="fr_pz39-7">1289</a> One commenter recommended that PII data never be exported, extracted, copied or downloaded in any manner or form from the CAT environment.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pACUe" NAME="fr_pACUe">1290</a> This commenter added that PII data should not be included in e-mail or other electronic communications, and advocated for use of a special CAT information management tool.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-3" NAME="fr_pz40-3">1291</a> Another commenter believed the PII should be excluded from direct query tools, reports or bulk data extraction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-4" NAME="fr_pz40-4">1292</a></p>
          <p id="a0360612-feda-4acc-b9d7-caf1371c36bb">In their response, the Participants noted that <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.10(c)(i)(B) of the Plan</a> provides that &#8220;[t]he user-defined direct queries and bulk extracts will provide authorized users with the ability to retrieve CAT Data via a query tool or language that allows users to query all available attributes and data sources.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-5" NAME="fr_pz40-5">1293</a> The Participants clarified that no customer-related information, including PII, will be included in response to queries of the broader order and transaction database, nor will it be available in bulk extract form.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-6" NAME="fr_pz40-6">1294</a> Instead, the Participants stated that customer-related information, such as PII, will be stored in a separate database, which can be accessed only in accordance with heightened security protocols.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-7" NAME="fr_pz40-7">1295</a> In such case, a regulatory user would have to be specifically authorized to access the database with PII and other customer-related information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-8" NAME="fr_pz40-8">1296</a> The Participants stated that they expect that the Plan Processor and the CISO will establish policies and procedures to identify abnormal usage of the database containing customer-related information, and to escalate concerns as necessary; and noted that the details regarding such policies and procedures will be determined once the Plan Processor has been selected.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-4" NAME="fr_pz41-4">1297</a></p>
          <p id="ddf529fe-75a9-4031-a431-11eed2bff420">With respect to the standards of protection for PII, the Commission notes that the Plan Processor must adhere to the NIST Risk Management Framework and implement baseline security controls identified in NIST Special Publication 800-53, which the Commission believes, when applied properly, are sufficiently rigorous industry standards for the protection of sensitive data such as PII.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-5" NAME="fr_pz41-5">1298</a> The Commission also believes that the Participants&#8217; general approach to treating PII differently &#8211; and with more stringent protections &#8211; than other CAT Data is also reasonable, given the highly sensitive nature of PII, and the risk that an individual Customer&#8217;s orders and transactions could be identified should the Central Repository&#8217;s data security protections be breached. Thus, the Commission believes that the Plan&#8217;s provisions which limit who can access PII and how PII can be accessed are a reasonable means of ensuring the protection of PII. Specifically, the Commission believes that requiring access to PII to follow RBAC, adhering to the &#8220;least privileged&#8221; practice of limiting access,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-6" NAME="fr_pz41-6">1299</a> restricting access to PII to those with a &#8220;need-to-know,&#8221; and requiring that any login system that is able to access PII must be further secured via MFA, are reasonable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-7" NAME="fr_pz41-7">1300</a></p>
          <p id="ea4003f1-5cf0-4ddd-82b4-b24ca74985ba">The Commission also believes that the Participants&#8217; approach to the use of PII is a reasonable means of protecting PII of Customers reported to the Central Repository. Specifically, the Commission believes that the Plan&#8217;s provisions setting out specific parameters applicable to the inclusion of PII in queries, as described by the Participants, is a reasonable approach to controlling the disclosure of PII and helps to ensure that PII will only be used by regulators for regulatory and surveillance purposes and, as set out in the Plan, for market reconstruction and analysis.</p>
          <p id="f8a5c568-383c-40f2-bc10-9dd4abcbfbe8">The Commission notes that the Plan and the Participants&#8217; response affirms that access to PII data will only be provided to a limited set of authorized individuals, and only for the limited purpose of conducting regulatory and surveillance activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-4" NAME="fr_pz42-4">1301</a> The Plan also contains an explicit prohibition on the ability to bulk download sensitive information such as PII, and this protection must be reinforced through the Plan Processor&#8217;s controls, policies and procedures.</p>
          <p id="f468868d-0e70-4ef5-9bdc-688f2853d03f">Thus, the Commission believes that the Plan&#8217;s provisions addressing the protections of PII, and the limitations on its access and use, provide a reasonable framework for the protection of PII. While it is concluding that the Plan sets forth a reasonable framework for the protection of PII, the Commission notes that the Plan Processor will continually assess, and the CISO and Operating Committee will vigorously oversee, the adequacy of the security of CAT Data, and in particular PII, and will promptly and thoroughly address any deficiencies that are identified.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-5" NAME="fr_pz42-5">1302</a></p>
          <p id="33a29c3e-01d0-47fc-a0e2-18058f00fb83">b. PII Scope: Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information</p>
          <p id="3528b6cf-a73c-4749-b41f-1ca86acc972f">One commenter requested clarification on the scope of PII, stating &#8220;[t]he exact scope of PII should be defined, i.e., are all fields associated with a customer included as PII?&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-4" NAME="fr_pz43-4">1303</a> In their response, the Participants provided additional clarification on their interpretation of PII, as well as on the scope of the Plan&#8217;s protections for all customer-related information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-5" NAME="fr_pz43-5">1304</a> Specifically, the Participants clarified that they view all customer-related information&#8212;not only PII, but also Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information&#8212;as the type of highly sensitive information that requires the highest level of protection under the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-6" NAME="fr_pz43-6">1305</a> The Participants further stated that because there is some inconsistency in how these terms are used in the Plan, to the extent that any statement in the Plan, including <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Central Repository">Section 6.10(c) of the Plan</a>, and Appendices C or D thereto, are inconsistent with the above description, the Participants recommend that the Commission amend the Plan to address any potential confusion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAXo2" NAME="fr_pAXo2">1306</a></p>
          <p id="db43b2e9-a909-4717-b490-4ba90e9807c3">The Commission agrees with the Participants and believes that the security of Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information, irrespective of whether it meets a common understanding of the definition of PII, should be subject to the highest standards of protection. Accordingly, the Commission is amending the definition of PII in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article I - Definitions, Definitions">Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan</a> to provide that PII means &#8220;personally identifiable information, including a social security number or tax identifier number or similar information; Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information.&#8221; The Commission believes that this amendment is reasonable in that it will ensure that all information that identifies a Customer will be afforded the same high levels of protection as data that the Participants initially defined as PII.</p>
          <p id="c261f4f5-2376-4153-9e18-fdd45711ed43">c. Storage of PII</p>
          <p id="f9dc6b38-7953-46c3-b666-6aeb60c2bcf0">Commenters also discussed the policies and procedures addressing storage of PII as a means to enhance the security and confidentiality of PII reported to the Central Repository. A few commenters stated that PII should be stored separately from other CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-7" NAME="fr_pz44-7">1307</a> One commenter stated that &#8220;PII must be segregated from other transactional data that will be stored by the CAT Processor.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-8" NAME="fr_pz44-8">1308</a> Another commenter opined that, while it does not believe that the CAT NMS Plan should mandate a particular storage method, it supported requiring PII to be stored separately, given its sensitive nature and the potential for identify theft or fraud.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-9" NAME="fr_pz44-9">1309</a></p>
          <p id="e4fc745d-03d9-4049-b29b-d90c8313c33c">In their response, the Participants clarified that they view all customer-related information (i.e., PII, including Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information) as highly sensitive information that requires the highest level of protection and, as such, all customer-related information will be stored in a different, physically separated architecture.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA2si" NAME="fr_pA2si">1310</a></p>
          <p id="88ee213c-a25e-4d64-9e81-e1516196816e">The Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s provisions regarding the storage of PII set forth a reasonable framework for the security of such data. The Plan further provides that the CAT infrastructure may not be commingled with other non-regulatory systems, including being segmented to the extent feasible on a network level, and data centers housing CAT systems must be AICPA SOC-2 certified by a qualified third party auditor that is not an affiliate of any Participant or the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz45-9" NAME="fr_pz45-9">1311</a></p>

          <p id="4e600bd7-6d76-4536-9872-91bdde434d7d">This commenter further supported an earlier start to the development of the Technical Specifications and stated that the six-month period contemplated by the CAT NMS Plan for the industry to test software that will interface with the Plan Processor is insufficient, particularly for third-party service providers and service bureaus.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-3" NAME="fr_pz48-3">1325</a> This commenter suggested, among other things, accelerating the availability of the CAT test environment to earlier in the implementation cycle and allowing a minimum of twelve months of access to the CAT test environment for the first group of Industry Member reporters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-4" NAME="fr_pz48-4">1326</a> Another commenter proposed a twelve-month testing period with clear criteria established before moving into production, including coordinated testing across industry participants and the vendors that support them.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-5" NAME="fr_pz48-5">1327</a> This commenter also noted that the testing plans that will be used for any potential move to T+2 would be useful in developing industry testing for the CAT and that error rates should be consistent with OATS for reports that are currently reported to OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-6" NAME="fr_pz48-6">1328</a> This commenter further suggested that robust testing that mirrors production will be necessary to ensure that the Plan Processor is capable of meeting the reporting and linkage requirements outlined in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-7" NAME="fr_pz48-7">1329</a></p>
          <p id="eb520597-9866-4f90-ba34-2f9f1a4e8546">In response to these commenters, the Participants explained that in light of their experience with testing timelines for other system changes, discussions with the Bidders, and other considerations, they continue to believe that the Plan sets forth an achievable testing timeline.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pARxs" NAME="fr_pARxs">1330</a> The Participants also acknowledged the importance of the development process for the Technical Specifications for all CAT Reporters and noted that they have emphasized this as a high priority with the Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-4" NAME="fr_pz49-4">1331</a></p>
          <p id="f88bdb11-3173-4e3d-aec3-3bd869b58c3b">The Participants stated that they &#8220;do not propose to amend the Plan to reflect an expedited schedule for the Industry Member Technical Specifications.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-6" NAME="fr_pz49-6">1332</a> In addition, the Participants indicated that while strategies to mitigate any risks in meeting the implementation milestones will be a necessary part of promoting the successful implementation of the CAT, they believe that formulating specifics regarding risk mitigation strategies will depend on the selected Plan Processor and its solution.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-6" NAME="fr_pz49-6">1333</a> Therefore, the Participants stated their belief that such risk mitigation strategies will be addressed as a part of the agreement between the Plan Processor and the CAT LLC, and implemented thereafter.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAd3j" NAME="fr_pAd3j">1334</a></p>
          <p id="da09d1ba-898e-4467-ae5b-bf6c9474c99d">The Commission agrees that prompt availability of Technical Specifications that provide detailed instructions on data submission and a robust period of testing CAT reporting functionality are important factors in ensuring that Industry Members are able to timely transition to CAT reporting and accurately report data to the Central Repository. In this regard, the Commission expects the Participants to ensure that the Technical Specifications will be published with sufficient time for CAT Reporters to program their systems, and strongly encourages the Participants and the Plan Processor to provide the earliest possible release of the initial Technical Specifications for Industry Member reporting and to begin accepting Industry Member data for testing purposes as soon as practicable. In addition, the Commission is amending Appendix C, Section C.10 of the Plan to ensure that the completion dates for the Technical Specifications, testing, and other development milestones designate firm outer limits, rather than &#8220;projected&#8221; completion dates, for the completion of these milestones. For example, as amended, the Plan will provide that the Plan Processor will begin developing Technical Specifications for Industry Member submission of order data no later than fifteen months before Industry Members are required to begin reporting this data, and will publish the final Technical Specifications no later than one year before Industry Members are required to begin reporting. Moreover, the Commission is amending Appendix C, Section C.10 of the Plan to clarify that the CAT testing environment will be made available to Industry Members on a voluntary basis no later than six months prior to when Industry Members are required to report data to the CAT and that more coordinated, structured testing of the CAT System will begin no later than three months prior to when Industry Members are required to report data to the CAT.</p>
          <p id="10741900-7e90-4d5f-9e6a-8d985ca863bc">The Commission acknowledges that the transition to CAT reporting will be a major initiative that should not be undertaken hastily, that Industry Members and service bureaus will need sufficient time to make the preparations necessary to comply with the reporting requirements of the Plan and the Technical Specifications, and the importance of thorough testing. However, the Commission does not believe that the Plan&#8217;s Technical Specification and testing timeframes are unachievable. Therefore, the Commission believes it is premature&#8212;one year before the Technical Specifications for Industry Members will be finalized, eighteen months before testing will begin, and before any problem with achieving these milestones has actually arisen&#8212;to consider amending the CAT NMS Plan to mandate a more protracted implementation schedule.</p>
          <p id="1a7f0e7a-1661-4580-af78-f3ef98265514">Similarly, the Commission continues to believe that the implementation dates that are explicitly provided in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>&#8212;for example, that Industry Members and Small Industry Members will begin reporting Industry Member data to the Central Repository within two or three years, respectively, of Plan approval<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-2" NAME="fr_pz51-2">1335</a>&#8212;are reasonable. As discussed above, the Plan provides appropriate interim milestones, such as iterative drafts of the Technical Specifications and a testing period, which will help prepare Industry Members to transition to CAT reporting pursuant to the implementation schedule set forth in the CAT NMS Plan. No issues complying with these dates have actually arisen, and the Commission is not altering these dates at this time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-3" NAME="fr_pz51-3">1336</a> In addition, with respect to the comment that strategies to mitigate the risks imposed by an &#8220;aggressive&#8221; implementation schedule&#8212;such as delays, poorly built systems, and an inferior quality of data reporting&#8212;should be included in the Plan, the Commission agrees with the Participants that formulating detailed risk mitigation strategies will depend upon the selected Plan Processor and its specific solution and will be addressed in the agreement between the Plan Processor and CAT NMS, LLC. Therefore, the Commission is not amending the Plan to require specific risk mitigation strategies at this time.</p>

          <p id="c7e8dbe8-a6fc-4a3d-96a0-388c8dfadbdc">In their response, the Participants explained that while the Technical Specifications will be important drivers of the implementation timeline, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> mandates certain compliance dates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-3" NAME="fr_pz54-3">1346</a> According to the Participants, delaying the assessment and definition of implementation milestones until the availability of the Technical Specifications would jeopardize the ability of the Participants to meet their obligations under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-3" NAME="fr_pz54-3">1347</a> However, the Participants also explained that &#8220;the steps leading up to the compliance dates set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613</a> can be tailored to the Technical Specifications&#8221; leaving room to accommodate specific developments related to the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-5" NAME="fr_pz54-5">1348</a> The Participants also expect the Plan Processor to provide more specific guidance as to steps toward implementation with the Technical Specifications and, to the extent that such guidance would require an amendment to the Plan&#8217;s implementation timelines, the Participants will propose to amend the Plan accordingly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-6" NAME="fr_pz54-6">1349</a> With respect to the comments recommending an iterative process between broker-dealers and the Plan Processor in developing final Technical Specifications, the Participants noted that the Plan, as drafted, already contemplates the publication of iterative drafts as needed before the final Technical Specifications are published.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pABmg" NAME="fr_pABmg">1350</a></p>
          <p id="7eeb4150-d873-422b-8a51-5f5ca734f4ed">As noted, the Commission does not believe it is necessary to tie completion dates for CAT implementation events or milestones to the release and review of Technical Specifications. The Commission believes that setting forth specific timeframes in the CAT NMS Plan for completing the various CAT implementation stages and tying these timeframes to the Effective Date rather than to subsequent events such as the release, review, or finalization of the Technical Specifications, is a reasonable approach to achieve a timely implementation of the CAT. Therefore, and the Commission is not deferring or reducing the specificity of these timeframes at this time.</p>
          <p id="afaf4656-bbe4-4952-9308-5040314bc813">In response to the comments suggesting that the Plan should provide for a more iterative process between Industry Members and the Plan Processor in the development of the Technical Specifications, as the Participants&#8217; response pointed out, the CAT NMS Plan provides that the Plan Processor will publish iterative drafts of the Technical Specifications as needed prior to the publication of the final Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-4" NAME="fr_pz55-4">1351</a> However, the Commission recognizes the importance of workable Technical Specifications, and notes that the Plan requires the Participants and the Plan Processor to work with Industry Members in an iterative process, as necessary, to develop effective final Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-5" NAME="fr_pz55-5">1352</a></p>

          <p id="96970c8b-dd15-4b93-b7f0-aa2aa63e64b3">The CAT NMS Plan provides that Small Industry Members&#8212;broker-dealers whose capital levels are below a certain limit defined by regulation&#8212;must report Industry Member Data to the Central Repository within three years of the Effective Date, as opposed to the two years provided to other Industry Members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-6" NAME="fr_pz56-6">1355</a></p>
          <p id="57072461-b7a6-4f12-a43b-078b58c1857b">Several commenters noted the impact the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s implementation schedule would have on small broker-dealers, clearing firms, and service bureaus. One commenter emphasized the need for sufficient lead time to enable small firms previously exempt from OATS reporting to establish the internal structure, technical expertise, systems, and contractual arrangements necessary for CAT reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-7" NAME="fr_pz56-7">1356</a> Other commenters suggested that only those firms that are exempt or excluded from OATS reporting obligations&#8212;rather than Small Industry Member firms based on capital levels as set forth in the CAT NMS Plan&#8212;should have an additional year to begin reporting to CAT, arguing that such a change would allow existing systems to be retired earlier at a significant cost savings.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-8" NAME="fr_pz56-8">1357</a> Similarly, another commenter noted the impact the phased implementation schedule would have upon third-party vendors, service bureaus, and correspondent clearing firms with both large and small clients, and suggested that dividing Industry Members based on whether or not they currently report to OATS is preferable to the capital level-based division proposed in the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz57-4" NAME="fr_pz57-4">1358</a></p>
          <p id="39dbb783-9b3f-4f17-a25a-020c4286f588">In response to these comments, the Participants explained their understanding that the Commission permitted additional compliance time for smaller firms because &#8220;small broker-dealers may face greater financial constraints in complying with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> as compared to larger broker-dealers&#8221; and that the Participants have based the implementation timeline on that framework.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz57-5" NAME="fr_pz57-5">1359</a> However, the Participants explained that they believe that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and the Plan already permit Small Industry Members to commence reporting to the CAT when large Industry Members begin reporting to the CAT on a voluntary basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz57-6" NAME="fr_pz57-6">1360</a> In addition, the Participants stated that accelerating the reporting requirements for all Small Industry Members that are OATS reporters to require them to begin reporting to the Central Repository two years after Plan approval, when Large Industry Members are required to report, may enable FINRA to retire OATS on a more expedited basis and that the Participants will consider including in their Compliance Rules a requirement to accelerate reporting for Small Industry Members that are OATS reporters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAMqjC" NAME="fr_pAMqjC">1361</a></p>
          <p id="2817edfc-af15-4e88-9e2e-819bbd297fa8">The Commission acknowledges that the capital-level based definition contained in the Plan is not the only way to define Small Industry Members for the purposes of the implementation schedule. However, this definition is derived from <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=87df2aa67f248d9fff0bb7e4f4d53853&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.270_10_610&amp;rgn=div8">Exchange Act Rule 0&#8211;10</a>,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz58-3" NAME="fr_pz58-3">1362</a> which defines small entities under the Exchange Act for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and reflects an &#8220;existing regulatory standard that is an indication of small entities for which regulators should be sensitive when imposing regulatory burdens.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz58-4" NAME="fr_pz58-4">1363</a> In addition, the group of firms that do not currently report to OATS is diverse, and includes some large broker-dealers and entities that&#8212;although they are not FINRA members and hence do not have regular OATS reporting obligations&#8212;nevertheless engage in a significant volume of trading activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AqZhZ" NAME="fr_AqZhZ">1364</a> Therefore, the Commission continues to believe, at this time, that the definition of Small Industry Member in the Plan is a reasonable means to identify market participants for which it would be appropriate to provide, and that would benefit from, an additional year to prepare for CAT reporting due to their relatively limited resources.</p>
          <p id="cc4459dd-43e6-4470-929c-02b758bcb381">In addition, the Commission encourages the Participants and the Plan Processor to work with Small Industry Members that are also OATS reporters to enable them to begin reporting to CAT, on a voluntary basis, at the same time that large Industry Members are required to begin reporting, particularly if the Participants believe that this would facilitate more expeditious retirement of OATS. Accordingly, the Commission is amending Appendix C, Section C.9 of the Plan to require the Participants to consider, in their rule change filings to retire duplicative systems,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAGptj" NAME="fr_pAGptj">1365</a> whether the availability of certain data from Small Industry Members two years after the Effective Date would facilitate a more expeditious retirement of duplicative systems. In addition, the Commission notes that FINRA is considering whether it can integrate CAT Data with OATS data in such a way that &#8220;ensures no interruption in FINRA&#8217;s surveillance capabilities,&#8221; and that FINRA will consider &#8220;exempting firms from the OATS Rules provided they report data to the Central Repository pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan and any implementing rules.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-3" NAME="fr_pz59-3">1366</a> The Commission encourages the other Participants to consider similar measures to exempt firms from reporting to existing systems once they are accurately reporting comparable data to the CAT and to enable the usage of CAT Data to conduct their regulatory activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-4" NAME="fr_pz59-4">1367</a> The Commission believes that this approach will reduce or eliminate the duplicative reporting costs of Industry Members prior to the commencement of Small Industry Member reporting.</p>
          <p id="2884ea5e-6a44-4d18-9e94-c740dddfd20d">The Commission remains open to other approaches to phasing in CAT reporting obligations that will promote the earlier retirement of reporting systems that will be rendered duplicative by the CAT. However, for the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that, at this time, the Plan&#8217;s definition of Small Industry Member is reasonable, and is therefore not amending the Plan to change this definition or to otherwise change the phased approach to CAT implementation.</p>

          <p id="cb26c102-0975-4192-ba21-a06c7ad7be05">In response to the comments suggesting the use of a trial period to transition to the CAT, the Participants stated that they recognize the concerns regarding the potential for disciplinary actions during the commencement of reporting to the CAT when, despite good faith efforts, reporting errors may develop due to the lack of experience with the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pATcI" NAME="fr_pATcI">1401</a> Accordingly, the Participants stated that they will take into consideration the lack of experience with the CAT when evaluating any potential regulatory concerns with CAT reporting during the first months after such reporting is required.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz67-3" NAME="fr_pz67-3">1402</a> In addition, the Participants stated that they intend to work together with Industry Members to facilitate their CAT reporting; for example, the CAT&#8217;s testing environments will provide an opportunity for Industry Members to gain experience with the CAT, and the Plan Processor will provide Industry Members with a variety of resources to assist them during onboarding and once CAT reporting begins, including user support and a help desk.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz67-4" NAME="fr_pz67-4">1403</a></p>
          <p id="7c969297-d328-4471-b1ee-04254e522761">The Commission acknowledges that a protracted period of duplicative reporting would impose significant costs on broker-dealers and recognizes the importance of retiring duplicative rules and systems as soon as possible and of setting forth an appropriate schedule to achieve such retirement in the CAT NMS Plan. As discussed above, although a broader review of the Participants&#8217; rules intended to identify any other impact that the CAT may have on the Participants&#8217; rules and systems generally is ongoing, the Participants have completed gap analyses for systems and rules identified for full or partial retirement, including larger systems such as OATS and COATS. The Participants have confirmed that the data needed to support the retirement of these key systems will be included in the CAT,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA06i" NAME="fr_pA06i">1404</a> and have proposed to accelerate the projected dates for completing these analyses of duplicative, partially duplicative, and non-duplicative rules and systems to nine to twelve months after Plan approval.</p>
          <p id="70bf27c4-29e5-408c-a3c6-f5443d19b472">Although the Commission appreciates these efforts to accelerate the retirement of existing data reporting rules and systems that are duplicative of the CAT, the Commission believes that stronger Plan amendments than those recommended by the Participants should be made to ensure that such rules and systems are eliminated, modified, or retired as soon as practicable after the CAT is operational so that the period of duplicative reporting is kept short. Therefore, the Commission is amending Section C.9 of Appendix C of the Plan to reflect the Participants&#8217; representation that their analyses of key duplicative systems are already complete and to provide that proposed rule changes to effect the retirement of duplicative systems, effective at such time as CAT Data meets minimum standards of accuracy and reliability, shall be filed with the Commission within six months of Plan approval.</p>
          <p id="a7cd6295-134a-40be-b573-a9fd3b148ad7">Based on the Participants&#8217; statement in their response to comments that their gap analyses are complete with respect to the major existing trade and order data reporting systems, the Commission believes that the process of assessing which systems can be retired after CAT is operational is in an advanced stage. Rather than amending the Plan to state that these analyses for duplicative systems will be complete within nine to twelve months of the Commission&#8217;s approval of the CAT NMS Plan, as recommended by the Participants, the Commission believes that the milestones listed in Appendix C should include the Participants&#8217; representation that they have completed gap analyses for key rules and systems and should enumerate those specific systems because this more accurately reflects, and more prominently and clearly conveys to market participants and the public, the status of the Participants&#8217; planning for the transition from existing systems to CAT.</p>
          <p id="d5bb67d5-317b-494d-ab6f-28a923b254cb">For these reasons, the Commission is also amending Section C.9 of Appendix C of the Plan to require the Participants to file with the Commission rule change proposals to modify or eliminate duplicative rules and systems within six months of the Effective Date. These filings will not effectuate an immediate retirement of duplicative rules and systems&#8212;the actual retirement of such rules and systems must depend upon the availability of comparable data in CAT of sufficient accuracy and reliability for regulatory oversight purposes, as specified in the Participants&#8217; rule change proposals. The Commission also is amending the Plan to require the Participants, in their rule change proposals, to discuss specific accuracy and reliability standards that will determine when duplicative systems will be retired, including, but not limited to, whether the attainment of a certain Error Rate should determine when a system duplicative of the CAT can be retired. Although these amendments were not suggested by the Participants, the Commission believes that the rule change filing milestone should be changed to six months from Plan approval given the status of the Participants&#8217; gap analyses and because the actual retirement of rules and systems will only occur once CAT Data meets minimum standards of accuracy and reliability. In addition, the Commission believes that an explicit statement in the Appendix C milestones that the retirement of systems that are duplicative of CAT shall occur once CAT Data meets minimum standards of accuracy and reliability will provide greater clarity regarding how the transition from existing reporting systems to the CAT will proceed. In addition, these amendments will better align the systems retirement schedule with the broader CAT implementation schedule. For example, requiring rule change proposals to be submitted to the Commission within six months will ensure that public comments, and Commission review of these comments, which could inform the development of the Technical Specifications, will be in progress as the Technical Specifications for Industry Member data submission are being developed (i.e., at least fifteen months before Industry Members are required to report to CAT).</p>
          <p id="617da320-f218-4ccf-b394-af961967b419">The Commission believes that, taken together, these amendments may facilitate an accelerated retirement of existing data reporting rules and systems that are duplicative of CAT and thus reduce the length of the duplicative reporting period as compared to the Plan as filed. Given that their requisite analytical work is already substantially complete, the Commission believes that the milestones, as amended, are achievable without a substantial increase in the burdens imposed on the Participants. Given the importance of retiring existing systems as rapidly as possible to reduce the substantial burdens on Industry Members that come with an extended period of duplicative reporting, the Commission believes that these amendments are appropriate. The CAT NMS Plan, as amended, recognizes that the Participants&#8217; requisite analytical work is already substantially complete and explicitly conditions the elimination of duplicative reporting only on the availability of accurate and reliable CAT Data that will enable the SROs to carry out their regulatory and oversight responsibilities. The amended Plan also accelerates the initiation of the formal process of retiring duplicative rules and systems by requiring that rule change filings be filed within six months of the Effective Date.</p>
          <p id="f5888102-c662-47e4-8105-e25314872616">The Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan, as amended, contains an appropriate level of detail regarding the process of retiring duplicative rules and systems. However, the Commission is not amending the Plan to include fixed or mandatory dates for the retirement of existing rules and systems at this time. As the Participants noted in their response to comments, retiring a system depends upon many factors, including the availability of sufficiently extensive and high quality CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAE2i" NAME="fr_pAE2i">1405</a> The Commission and the SROs will continue to rely on the information collected through existing regulatory reporting systems to reconstruct market events, conduct market analysis and research in support of regulatory decision-making, and conduct market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions until sufficiently complete, accurate, and reliable data is available through CAT. Therefore, precise dates for retiring these rules and systems cannot be determined prospectively. However, the Commission agrees with the Participants that they have incentives to retire extraneous systems after CAT is operational due to the desire to avoid the costs associated with maintaining such systems; the Commission believes that these incentives will mitigate any delay that would otherwise result from the difficulty of setting forth specific system retirement dates in advance.</p>
          <p id="f2511247-d062-4363-92aa-d08808a24072">As discussed above, the gap analyses completed by the Participants regarding the key existing trade and order data systems have confirmed that the CAT contains the data fields necessary to retire these systems, and the Commission has amended the Plan to ensure that any additional analysis related to duplicative rule and system retirement is completed in a timely manner. The Participants also explained that once the Plan Processor is selected, the Participants will work with the Plan Processor and Industry Members to develop detailed Technical Specifications that ensure that by the time Industry Members are required to report to the CAT, the CAT will include all data elements necessary to facilitate the rapid retirement of duplicative systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAAK4" NAME="fr_pAAK4">1406</a> The Commission agrees that the Participants should work with the Plan Processor and Industry Members in this manner and provide appropriate information about how they use trade and order data collected through existing rules and systems to ensure that the Technical Specifications are developed with these requirements in mind. In addition, with respect to the comment that CAT should be designed to permit the inclusion of additional data fields, the Commission notes that the Plan contains provisions regarding periodic reviews and upgrades to CAT that could lead to proposing additional data fields that are deemed important,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz72-6" NAME="fr_pz72-6">1407</a> and does not believe any changes to the Plan are necessary.</p>

          <p id="d00bbac9-bdac-4077-a5e0-5fdfbfee3758">In response to comments concerning a moratorium on changes to new systems, the Participants explained that they plan to minimize the number of changes that are rolled out to duplicative systems to the extent possible.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz77-6" NAME="fr_pz77-6">1431</a> The Participants, however, cannot commit to making no changes to the duplicative systems as some changes may be necessary before these systems are retired&#8212;for example, changes to these duplicative systems may need to be made to address Commission initiatives, new order types or security-related changes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA3oCM" NAME="fr_pA3oCM">1432</a></p>
          <p id="7d4b26ec-0c6a-44a5-8492-8c6aeb65480f">The Commission agrees with the commenters that the accuracy of the data reported to CAT, as in part measured by CAT Reporters&#8217; Error Rate, should be a factor in determining whether and when duplicative trade and order data rules and systems should be eliminated. As discussed above, the rule change proposals regarding duplicative systems retirement that the Participants will file with the Commission within six months of the Effective Date must condition the elimination of existing data reporting systems on CAT Data meeting minimum standards of accuracy and reliability. The Commission believes that this approach may incentivize accurate CAT reporting because it could potentially allow Industry Members to retire redundant, and costly to maintain, systems sooner. The Commission believes that any such improvements in accuracy, together with the amended Plan&#8217;s reduction of the period for the Participants to complete their analyses of duplicative, partially duplicative, and non-duplicative rules and its acceleration of the requirement to file system elimination rule change proposals, should facilitate an earlier retirement of duplicative systems. However, the Commission does not believe that a specific Error Rate that would automatically trigger the elimination of the collection of data through an existing, duplicative system can be set in advance, through a Plan amendment at this time. Rather, the more flexible standard set forth in the Plan, as amended&#8212;that duplicative systems will be retired as soon as possible after data of sufficient accuracy and reliability to ensure that the Participants can effectively carry out their regulatory obligations is available in CAT&#8212;recognizes the primacy of ensuring that CAT Data can be used to perform all regulatory functions before existing systems are retired, and is therefore more appropriate.</p>
          <p id="791d458e-a2d3-4bad-bc1c-c58385cc318a">In response to the comments regarding individual exemptions from reporting to duplicative systems for Industry Members whose CAT reporting meets certain quality thresholds, the Commission supports the Participants&#8217; efforts to explore whether this can be feasibly accomplished by adding functionality to permit cross-system regulatory analyses that would minimize duplicative reporting obligations or, in the case of OATS, integrating CAT Data with data collected by OATS. Accordingly, the Commission is amending Section C.9 of Appendix C of the Plan to require that the Participants consider, in their rule filings to retire duplicative systems, whether individual Industry Members can be exempted from reporting to duplicative systems once their CAT reporting meets specified accuracy standards, including, but not limited to, ways in which establishing cross-system regulatory functionality or integrating data from existing systems and the CAT would facilitate such individual Industry Member exemptions. However, the Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate, at this time, to amend the Plan to require the Participants to grant such individual exemptions because, as noted by the Participants, it may not be feasible to implement the technological and organizational mechanisms that would obviate the need for duplicative reporting by ensuring that the Participants can effectively carry out their regulatory obligations using CAT Data.</p>
          <p id="b7f5a3dd-4240-42ff-bf1f-97f2061ccd42">In response to the comment that the CAT should be designed from the outset to include the ability to implement all of the surveillance methods and functions currently used by the Participants, the Commission notes that the Participants have indicated that they have provided the Bidders with their surveillance and investigative use cases, that each Bidder has been required to demonstrate its ability to meet these criteria, and that the selected Plan Processor will have the capability to provide the necessary surveillance methods and functions to allow for the retirement of duplicative systems. Therefore, the Commission believes that the CAT is being designed to include the ability to implement all of the surveillance methods and functions currently used by the Participants, and is not amending the Plan in response to this comment.</p>
          <p id="e1c4cecb-eff9-451b-a1ab-67e7a165bf83">In response to the commenter that suggested a specific principles-based framework for retiring duplicative systems,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-3" NAME="fr_pz80-3">1433</a> the Commission believes that, in general, the principles outlined in the CAT NMS Plan for retiring potentially duplicative rules and systems are reasonable. The principles outlined in the Plan recognize that the Participants and the Commission will continue to rely on information collected through existing regulatory reporting systems to reconstruct market events, conduct market analysis and research in support of regulatory decision-making, and conduct market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions until analogous information is available through CAT. Some period of duplicative reporting may be necessary to ensure that regulators can obtain accurate and reliable information through CAT to carry out these functions. However, the Commission also agrees that the CAT Reporter support, testing, and validation tools created for the CAT&#8212;rather than similar tools associated with legacy reporting systems&#8212;should be used to assist Industry Members as they transition to CAT reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-4" NAME="fr_pz80-4">1434</a></p>
          <p id="03f1d884-c641-48d0-ae69-c5703ec0f84b">The Commission agrees with the Participants that there cannot be a moratorium on changes to existing systems in connection with the launch of CAT. As discussed above, the Commission and the SROs use the information collected through existing regulatory reporting systems to carry out a variety of regulatory functions. Until these systems are fully retired, the Commission and the SROs will continue to rely upon these systems to obtain the information they need to perform these functions. Therefore, because changes to these systems may be necessary for the Commission or the SROs to obtain such information, the Commission does not believe a moratorium should be imposed on changes to these systems. However, the Commission supports the Participants&#8217; commitment to minimizing changes to existing systems and encourages the Participants to consider the necessity of any such changes and any additional burden such changes would impose on their members during the period in which members are transitioning to CAT reporting. Accordingly, the Commission is amending Section C.9 of Appendix C of the Plan to state that between the Effective Date and the retirement of the Participants&#8217; duplicative systems, each Participant, to the extent practicable, will attempt to minimize changes to those duplicative systems.</p>

The Commission believes that assessing Error Rates on a pre-correction basis is important to ensure that CAT Reporters submit CAT Data in compliance with the Plan and applicable rules of the Participants, and develop and maintain their reporting systems in a way that minimizes errors. In addition, focusing on Error Rates for pre-corrected data should reduce reliance on the error correction process, and improve the accuracy of the &#8220;uncorrected&#8221; CAT Data available to regulators in circumstances where immediate action is required.

          <p id="89226009-225e-4715-92fa-07d3a7cfa8b8">The Commission believes that the proposed 5% initial maximum Error Rate is reasonable and strikes an appropriate balance between: (1) ensuring that the initial submissions to the Central Repository by CAT Reporters are sufficiently accurate for regulatory use; and (2) providing CAT Reporters with time to adjust to the new more comprehensive regulatory reporting mechanism. The Commission understands that the Participants considered relevant historical information related to OATS reporting error rates, particularly when new reporting requirements were introduced, and believes this is a reasonable basis for setting the initial maximum Error Rates for CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-6" NAME="fr_pz97-6">1516</a> The Commission understands that CAT Reporters who currently report to OATS report with a significantly lower Error Rate, but recognizes that more flexibility may be necessary during the transition, and notes the 1% maximum Error Rate applicable to each CAT Reporter one year after their reporting obligation has begun is comparable to current OATS reporting error rates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-5" NAME="fr_pz98-5">1517</a></p>

The Plan requires the Plan Processor regularly to provide information and recommendations regarding Error Rates to the Operating Committee,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-6" NAME="fr_pz98-6">1518</a> and requires the Operating Committee to review and reset the maximum Error Rate at least on an annual basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-7" NAME="fr_pz98-7">1519</a> Given the importance to regulators of audit trail information that meets high standards of accuracy, the Commission expects the Plan Processor and Participants to closely monitor Error Rates, particularly in the early stages of CAT implementation, so that steps can be taken to reduce the maximum Error Rate as promptly as possible. The Commission also encourages the Plan Processor and Participants to assess the impact of significant changes to the CAT or applicable regulations on the maximum Error Rate, at least on a transitional basis, and provide additional flexibility as warranted. As described in Section IV.H, the Commission is amending Section 6.6 of the Plan to require that, prior to the implementation of any Material Systems Change, the Participants provide the Commission with an assessment of the projected impact of any Material Systems Change on the maximum Error Rate.</p>

The Commission does not believe that one industry standard should apply across all CAT Reporters and systems. Therefore, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(c) of the Plan</a> to state that industry standards for purposes of clock synchronization should be determined based on the type of CAT Reporter, type of Industry Member and type of system.</p>

While the Commission believes that regulators&#8217; ability to sequence orders accurately in certain cases could improve if the clock synchronization for Industry Members were finer, the Commission is sensitive to the costs associated with requiring a finer clock synchronization for Industry Members at this time, and believes that a standard of 50 milliseconds for Industry Members will allow regulators to sequence orders and events with a level of accuracy that is acceptable for the initial phases of CAT reporting.</p>
          <p id="ba5ea8c6-85bf-4f34-a5b5-37ec2ff1c6c3">Although the Commission understands that certain Industry Members, such as ATSs and broker-dealers that internalize off-exchange order flow, today adhere to a finer clock synchronization standard, the Commission is not imposing a finer standard than 50 milliseconds for such Industry Members at this time. The Commission believes that it is reasonable to expect that finer clock synchronization for Industry Members, or certain categories or systems thereof, will evolve over time. As described in Section IV.H, the Commission is amending the Plan to require that the Participants provide the Commission an assessment of clock synchronization standards, including consideration of industry standards based on the type of Industry Member or type of system, within six (6) months of effectiveness of the Plan.</p>

The Commission believes that because the Participants already synchronize their clocks to this standard,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz116-4" NAME="fr_pz116-4">1598</a> any costs to comply with this standard are not likely to be substantial.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz116-5" NAME="fr_pz116-5">1599</a> In addition, the Commission believes that a finer clock synchronization requirement for exchanges generally should allow regulators to better sequence orders and order events across multiple exchanges.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz116-6" NAME="fr_pz116-6">1600</a> The Commission agrees with the Participants that it would not be appropriate to impose this finer standard with regard to Participants&#8217; manual systems, given that the timing of manual events is inherently less precise and the timestamp requirement for manual events is only to the second.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAxVh" NAME="fr_pAxVh">1601</a> Accordingly, the Commission believes the one-second clock synchronization standard set forth in the Plan with respect to Manual Order Events, whether generated by the Participants or Industry Members, is reasonable.</p>

In particular, as technology advances over time, the Commission believes that it will be appropriate for the Participants to consider whether some CAT Reporters should be required to maintain a finer clock synchronization than required by the Plan today. As the Participants conduct their annual reviews, the Commission expects them to consider proposing new clock synchronization standards whenever they determine the industry standard for CAT Reporters, or certain categories or systems thereof, has become more granular than required by the Plan at that time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz117-3" NAME="fr_pz117-3">1602</a> As discussed in Section IV.H., the Commission is amending Section 6.6 of the Plan to require that the Participants provide the Commission with a copy of the annual assessment performed by the Plan Processor pursuant to Section 6.8(c) of the Plan.</p>

          <p id="dd974084-91ee-4dc0-a213-79bddd47c7b0">One commenter emphasized the importance of having comprehensive Technical Specifications that incorporate feedback from industry.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-5" NAME="fr_pz128-5">1652</a> Another commenter stated that because CAT is new and complex, time should be built into the schedule to permit two iterative reviews of the Technical Specifications before they are considered final.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-6" NAME="fr_pz128-6">1653</a> This commenter suggested that this review period should be no less than six months, arguing that the current timeframes to develop and test the Technical Specifications for the reporting of information to identify a Customer, in particular, are insufficient.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-7" NAME="fr_pz128-7">1654</a> Another commenter suggested that the review process with respect to Technical Specifications for reporting order data and information to identify a Customer should begin two months after a Plan Processor is selected and continue for nine months.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-8" NAME="fr_pz128-8">1655</a></p>
          <p id="7b729257-07f4-470e-80b6-be54a2c7f95d">One commenter recommended that the Technical Specifications for Industry Members be prepared concurrently with the Technical Specifications for Participants to provide them with more time to review and implement any necessary changes, particularly with regard to interfaces that the Participants and Industry Members will use.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-9" NAME="fr_pz128-9">1656</a> The commenter also recommended that the implementation schedule address allocation reporting and suggested that Technical Specifications for allocation reporting be provided at the same time as those for reporting order data and information to identify a Customer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-4" NAME="fr_pz129-4">1657</a> The commenter also stated that very detailed and timely information regarding CAT interfaces, message, and file formats in the Technical Specifications are essential due to the aggressive timeline for implementation of CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-5" NAME="fr_pz129-5">1658</a></p>
          <p id="dcfcb1b0-3b7a-4301-a43f-030971a5f64d">In response to these commenters, the Participants acknowledged the importance of the development process for the Technical Specifications for all CAT Reporters and emphasized that in their discussions with the Bidders, they have made development of Technical Specifications a high priority.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-6" NAME="fr_pz129-6">1659</a> Although the Participants noted that the Plan would not prohibit the Plan Processor from concurrently developing the Participant and Industry Member Technical Specifications, they explained that &#8220;in light of various practical issues raised by the pending decisions regarding the selection of the Plan Processor, the Participants do not propose to amend the Plan to reflect an expedited schedule for the Industry Member Technical Specifications.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-7" NAME="fr_pz129-7">1660</a></p>
          <p id="bef33e81-5a29-48f1-9d53-b31429c345d0">In their response to comments regarding industry input on the Technical Specifications, the Participants stated that they believe that iterative interactions regarding the Technical Specifications would be beneficial in optimizing the efficiency and quality of the final Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgDV" NAME="fr_pAgDV">1661</a> The Participants further explained that Appendix C of the Plan contemplates the publication of iterative drafts of the Technical Specifications, with respect to the submission of order data, as needed before the final Technical Specifications are published, noting that this language provides the flexibility for iterative drafts, as necessary.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz130-4" NAME="fr_pz130-4">1662</a></p>
          <p id="4b75f092-49ce-4912-b2ad-72bf721e4356">In their response to comments, the Participants also recommended amendments to the Plan to better align the milestones related to the submission of order data to the Central Repository with the milestones for the submission of Customer Account Information to the Central Repository. Specifically, the Participants recommended explicitly including milestones for the beginning of the Plan Processor&#8217;s development of Technical Specifications for the submission of Customer Account Information and for the publication of iterative drafts of such Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz130-5" NAME="fr_pz130-5">1663</a> However, the Participants did not recommend aligning the timeframe for the publication of Technical Specifications for the submission of Customer Account Information (six months prior to when Industry Members are required to begin reporting to the Central Repository) with the timeframe for the publication of Technical Specifications for the submission of order data (one year prior to when Industry Members are required to begin reporting to the Central Repository), explaining that reporting order data to the CAT will be a significantly more complex process than reporting Customer Account Information and that therefore it is appropriate to allow Industry Members more time to review Technical Specifications and to begin testing their systems with regard to order data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA3baq" NAME="fr_pA3baq">1664</a></p>
          <p id="c7b02f94-3af6-4677-b1db-b66ed55cd938">The Commission recognizes the importance of providing sufficient opportunity for CAT Reporters to provide input as the Technical Specifications are developed. As noted by the Participants, Appendix C of the CAT NMS Plan, as recommended to be amended by the Participants in their response to comments,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-3" NAME="fr_pz131-3">1665</a> provides that, for the submission processes for both order data and information to identify a Customer, the Plan Processor will begin developing the Technical Specifications fifteen months prior to Industry Member reporting and will publish iterative drafts of the Technical Specifications as needed prior to the publication of the final Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-4" NAME="fr_pz131-4">1666</a> In addition, the Participants stated that they will &#8220;work with the Plan Processor and the industry to develop detailed Technical Specifications.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-5" NAME="fr_pz131-5">1667</a></p>
          <p id="c66fd099-197a-4813-9108-3e7bcbebb71d">Based on these provisions of the Plan and the Participants&#8217; statements in their response, the Commission understands that the Participants will work with and consider input from Industry Members during the Technical Specification drafting and development processes. The Commission further understands that the milestones in the Plan regarding the development of the Technical Specifications will keep Industry Members reasonably informed as to the status and content of the Technical Specifications and will permit Industry Members, whether through the Advisory Committee or other, more informal mechanisms, to provide input on the Technical Specifications as they are being developed. As discussed above, the Plan requires the Participants and the Plan Processor to work with Industry Members in an iterative process, as necessary, to develop effective final Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA3JB" NAME="fr_pA3JB">1668</a> However, the Commission believes that providing the Plan Processor with some flexibility regarding the mechanics of the Technical Specification development process is appropriate, and that it would be premature at this time to provide for mandatory iterative interactions or to require a specific number of iterations.</p>
          <p id="5f950158-8b41-42c9-ad5d-00711ef0a6b3">In addition, the Commission believes it will be beneficial for the milestones for the submission of order data and information to identify a Customer to be as aligned as possible so that all stakeholders can identify issues and present solutions on these related processes simultaneously. The Commission believes that the Participants&#8217; recommendations to include specific milestones for the commencement of the development of Technical Specifications for the submission of Customer Account Information and for the publication of iterative drafts of such Technical Specifications are reasonable, and is therefore amending the Plan accordingly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz132-3" NAME="fr_pz132-3">1669</a> Although not specifically recommended in the Participant&#8217;s response, the Commission is also amending the Plan to clarify that the milestones for the submission of information to identify a Customer apply to Customer Identifying Information as well as Customer Account Information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz132-4" NAME="fr_pz132-4">1670</a> The Commission understands that the term Customer Identifying Information was inadvertently omitted from Appendix C, Section C.10(a), and therefore believes it is appropriate to amend the Plan to add this term to the milestones applicable to the development of Technical Specifications for Customer data submission.</p>
          <p id="9773f7c2-ade9-4dbb-8760-ae8b4953e66d">The Commission agrees with the Participants that the reporting of order data to the Central Repository is likely to be significantly more complex than the reporting of Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information to the Central Repository because of the greater number of data elements and reporting requirements for order data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz133-4" NAME="fr_pz133-4">1671</a> Therefore, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the milestones in Appendix C of the Plan to state that the Plan Processor will publish the Technical Specifications for the submission of order data prior to the publication of Technical Specifications for the submission of Customer Account Information and Customer Identifying Information to permit Industry Members to spend additional time reviewing the order data Technical Specifications and testing their order data submission systems and processes.</p>
          <p id="0c263542-d367-4c8c-b914-4fbaeb9f6139">In response to the comments recommending that Technical Specifications for Participants and Industry Members be developed concurrently, the Commission agrees with the Participants that the completion dates associated with the development, iterative drafting, and final release of the Technical Specifications for both Participants and Industry Members set forth outer limits on when such milestones must be completed,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz133-5" NAME="fr_pz133-5">1672</a> which would not preclude the concurrent development of Participant and Industry Member Technical Specifications. The Commission further agrees that such concurrent development could be beneficial since it would permit all stakeholders to be apprised of issues and to offer solutions simultaneously and, accordingly, encourages the Participants and the Plan Processor to develop the Technical Specifications in this manner, if feasible. However, given that the Plan Processor, which will be primarily responsible for developing the Technical Specifications, will not be selected until after the Plan is approved, and that the Plan Processor has a variety of other responsibilities related to the development of the CAT, the Commission believes that providing the Plan Processor with flexibility regarding the mechanics of the Technical Specification development process is reasonable and is not amending the Plan to require concurrent development of Participant and Industry Member Technical Specifications. Moreover, the Commission believes that the sequencing of Technical Specification milestones in the Plan&#8212;for example, that development of Technical Specifications for Participant reporting of order data to the Central Repository should begin ten months before Participants are required to begin reporting data to the Central Repository while development of Technical Specifications for Industry Member reporting of order data to the Central Repository should begin fifteen months before Industry Members are required to begin reporting data to the Central Repository<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz134-3" NAME="fr_pz134-3">1673</a>&#8212;reflects a reasonable prioritization in light of the phased implementation of Participant and Industry Member reporting.</p>
          <p id="f28d7f5b-f130-4937-8297-2b84a3efcf26">Similarly, with respect to the period of time that Industry Members will have to review and provide input on the Technical Specifications for Industry Member data reporting, the Commission notes that, because the Plan Processor may begin developing the Technical Specifications earlier than fifteen months prior to Industry Member reporting, and because the Plan Processor may seek Industry Member comment on draft Technical Specifications, there may in effect be a period of Technical Specification review that is longer than suggested by a strict interpretation of the milestones in Appendix C. Therefore, the Commission is not amending the Plan to revise these timeframes.</p>
          <p id="55ac07a2-11a4-4f86-893d-d902ce96e70b">However, as discussed above, the Commission expects that the Technical Specifications will be published with sufficient time for CAT Reporters to program their systems to satisfy their reporting obligations under the Plan and is amending Appendix C, Section C.10 of the Plan to ensure that the completion dates for the Technical Specification development milestones designate firm outer limits, rather than &#8220;projected&#8221; completion dates, for the completion of these milestones.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz135-6" NAME="fr_pz135-6">1674</a> Therefore, the Commission is amending the Plan to provide for a minimum period of three months during which the Plan Processor and Industry Members will work together to develop the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz135-7" NAME="fr_pz135-7">1675</a></p>
          <p id="9df2a684-5d27-4263-be1a-c34d15c0a4ab">b. Impact on Industry Members</p>
          <p id="58c5e417-ab22-4367-b80c-f517156ebdbf">One commenter stated that changes that SROs require of their members&#8217; systems and processes can be costly in terms of both dollars and human capital.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz135-8" NAME="fr_pz135-8">1676</a> The commenter also noted that these changes are often subject to short implementation time periods and there is a lack of opportunity for discussion of concerns about the extent to which such new requirements can potentially expose the markets and investors to unnecessary risk.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAzhTN" NAME="fr_pAzhTN">1677</a> This commenter recommended that any new CAT requirements that will be imposed by the Participants on broker-dealers should be done through the SRO rulemaking process to afford market participants the opportunity to discuss any proposed changes with the Participants and the Commission, and to provide a sufficient lead time to implement necessary systems and coding changes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz136-4" NAME="fr_pz136-4">1678</a></p>
          <p id="fe8af55a-9984-43bc-a795-6d11140ac694">The Participants explained in their response that they do not believe, generally, that the Technical Specifications are required to be filed with the Commission under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a>,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz136-5" NAME="fr_pz136-5">1679</a> and cautioned that requiring rule filings may introduce significant delays in the process of developing the Technical Specifications. The Participants stated that in the normal course they do not intend to file the Technical Specifications with the Commission, but noted that to the extent that a change to the Technical Specifications is significant enough to require a change to the Plan, then such an amendment to the Plan would be filed pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz136-6" NAME="fr_pz136-6">1680</a></p>
          <p id="7cf16312-cca4-4582-92dc-2be28818e722">As discussed above, the Commission recognizes the importance of providing sufficient opportunity for all CAT Reporters to provide input as the initial Technical Specifications are developed, and believes that the Technical Specification development process outlined in the Plan, as amended&#8212;including the iterative interactions discussed above&#8212;will provide such an opportunity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAHstR" NAME="fr_pAHstR">1681</a> The Commission believes that the completion dates for the availability of final Technical Specifications&#8212;e.g., no later than one year before Industry Members are required to report data to the Central Repository for the release of Technical Specifications governing Industry Member reporting of order data&#8212;are reasonable and provide Industry Members with sufficient lead time to adjust their systems or make other preparations necessary to comply with the Technical Specifications, particularly since drafts of the Technical Specifications will likely have been available even earlier and Industry Members will have been involved in the process of developing the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz137-3" NAME="fr_pz137-3">1682</a></p>
          <p id="e8ad0929-8070-4330-89c4-535d9e56c165">The Commission recognizes that there may be costs associated with complying with technical or operational changes in reporting requirements. The Commission notes that Material Amendments to the Technical Specifications&#8212;i.e., amendments that would &#8220;require a Participant or an Industry Member to engage in significant changes to the coding necessary to submit information to the Central Repository&#8221;&#8212;must be approved by a Supermajority Vote of the Operating Committee, so the Plan provides additional controls with respect to changes to the Technical Specifications that could potentially be costly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz137-4" NAME="fr_pz137-4">1683</a> In addition, the Advisory Committee, which includes Industry Member representation, will be able to raise Industry Member concerns regarding any unexpected or costly requirements in the Technical Specifications with the Operating Committee. Moreover, while the Commission agrees with the Participants that changes to the Technical Specifications generally will not be required to be filed with the Commission, the Participants must comply with the CAT NMS Plan as approved by the Commission,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAW1_" NAME="fr_pAW1_">1684</a> which constrains the ability of the Operating Committee to approve major changes that would alter the scope of the CAT NMS Plan through Technical Specifications. In addition, the Commission will oversee the Participants&#8217; compliance with the Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-5" NAME="fr_pz138-5">1685</a> which provides an additional protection against the Participants or Plan Processor attempting to include changes in the Technical Specifications that properly should be filed as Plan amendments.</p>
          <p id="061887ce-a42c-4fb5-b4ec-72d81756897b">c. Technical Specifications Content</p>
          <p id="4d3ef159-6251-4bcd-a140-62b75ff3405c">Several commenters noted that the Technical Specifications for CAT must be robust and comprehensive.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-6" NAME="fr_pz138-6">1686</a> Some commenters recommended that specific elements be included in the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-7" NAME="fr_pz138-7">1687</a> One commenter recommended that the Participants ensure the Technical Specifications include provisions to ensure that multiple service providers are able to connect to CAT to report CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-8" NAME="fr_pz138-8">1688</a> Another commenter stressed the importance of including connectivity requirements in the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AIfcVY" NAME="fr_AIfcVY">1689</a> This commenter also stated that achievement of the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s reporting requirement would be dependent on the details in the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AvgmS" NAME="fr_AvgmS">1690</a> Another commenter stated that while it supports the reporting procedures identified in the CAT NMS Plan, &#8220;clearly defined technical guidelines for field specifications under different trading scenarios&#8221; are also needed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-9" NAME="fr_pz138-9">1691</a> A different commenter stated that the items to be included in the Technical Specifications &#8220;inappropriately constrain&#8221; the design of the CAT system to &#8220;too rigidly follow a traditional SQL database design&#8221; to the exclusion of more sophisticated analytical approaches.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-4" NAME="fr_pz139-4">1692</a></p>
          <p id="3db5aac4-0f45-477c-b325-8ab1b1ae92ae">In response, the Participants explained that they believe that each of these items are more appropriately addressed in the Technical Specifications, and should not be incorporated as requirements of the Plan. Nevertheless, the Participants explained that they believe that each of the elements identified by the commenters will be incorporated into the Technical Specifications developed by the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-5" NAME="fr_pz139-5">1693</a></p>
          <p id="649c46ef-69cd-4bd8-8b7c-7e1e85c1ead3">The Commission acknowledges the importance of timely, comprehensive, and detailed Technical Specifications that will provide all CAT Reporters with effective guidance on how to report data to the Central Repository. The Commission notes that the CAT NMS Plan specifies a number of parameters for what the Technical Specifications must contain, including specifications for the layout of files and records submitted to the Central Repository and the process for file submissions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-6" NAME="fr_pz139-6">1694</a> The Commission believes that it may be beneficial to include the elements referenced by the commenters, such as details regarding the submission of data for the Customer definition process and options order reporting, in the Technical Specifications, but believes that it is reasonable to allow the Plan Processor, with input from Industry Members during the iterative drafting process, to have some flexibility in determining these details of the Technical Specifications. In addition, the Participants have indicated that the elements referenced by the commenters will be incorporated into the Technical Specifications, and therefore the Commission does not believe it is necessary to amend the Plan to require these elements.</p>
          <p id="bb97fa00-6906-4219-baf9-482c80219520">In response to the comment that the Plan&#8217;s parameters regarding the content of the Technical Specifications are too rigid and limit the ability of the Plan Processor to offer certain design solutions, the Commission believes that the parameters strike an appropriate balance between providing the Bidders flexibility to offer a variety of solutions on the one hand and including some baseline requirements for the Technical Specifications on the other, and does not believe these parameters will inappropriately constrain the solutions that the Plan Processor can develop.</p>

        <p id="10af31dd-1957-41a1-955a-0f330626eae3">In response, the Participants stated that the Company is expected to be operated on a &#8220;break-even&#8221; basis, with fees imposed to cover costs and an appropriate reserve, and explained that any surpluses would be treated as an operational reserve to offset future fees and would not be distributed to the Participants as profits.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz142-2" NAME="fr_pz142-2">1705</a> In addition, the Participants stated that they received advice from counsel to CAT NMS, LLC that the Company could qualify for tax exempt status as a &#8220;business league&#8221; under <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section501&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code</a> and decided to have the Company apply for such status to allow it to establish reserves from the fees paid to the Company without incurring income taxes on those amounts.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz142-3" NAME="fr_pz142-3">1706</a> Accordingly, to ensure that the Company can qualify for the business league exemption, the Participants proposed that the Commission amend the Plan so that the Company is treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, that distributions, if any, are made consistent with the purposes of <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section501&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code</a>, and that certain other Plan provisions related to distributions to the Participants or to the taxation of the Company as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes be eliminated.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz142-4" NAME="fr_pz142-4">1707</a> In particular, the Participants suggested that the Commission amend the Plan to delete in its entirety <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VII - Intentionally Omitted">Article VII</a>, which pertains to Capital Accounts maintained by the Company for each Participant, and to replace <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VIII - Tax Status">Article VIII</a>, which pertains to allocations of income and loss and distributions, with a provision stating that the Company intends to operate in a manner such that it qualifies as a business league within the meaning of <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section501&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">"&gt;Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code</a>, and requiring the Operating Committee to submit an application to the Internal Revenue Service to attain such status for the Company.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz142-5" NAME="fr_pz142-5">1708</a></p>
        <p id="8fd89e83-facb-40b3-8dbd-3d85306344da">The Commission believes that the Participants&#8217; stated intent to operate the CAT on a break-even basis is appropriate.

To ensure the CAT is operated in this manner, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article XI - Funding of the Company, Funding Authority">Section 11.1(c)</a> of the CAT NMS Plan to require that any surplus of the Company&#8217;s revenues over its expenses will be treated as an operational reserve to offset future fees. The Commission believes this amendment is reasonable because it formalizes the representation made by the Participants, and provides certainty that the Participants&#8217; operation of the CAT will not contribute to the funding of their other operations. The Commission notes that, under the Exchange Act, any fees proposed to be charged by the Participants to fund the CAT must be filed as proposed rule changes pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_119b_64">Rule 19b-4(f)(2)</a> or filed pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608(b)(3)(i)</a><a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz143-3" NAME="fr_pz143-3">1709</a> with the Commission, published for public comment, and meet statutory standards with respect to reasonableness, equitable allocation, and other matters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz144-4" NAME="fr_pz144-4">1710</a></p>

The Commission further believes that the proposed funding model is designed to impose fees reasonably related to the Participants&#8217; self-regulatory obligations because the fees would be directly associated with the costs of establishing and maintaining the CAT, and not unrelated SRO services. The Commission emphasizes that the CAT NMS Plan does not set forth, and the Commission is not hereby approving, the specific fees to be charged by the Participants; rather, such fee proposals later will be separately filed with the Commission by the Participants, published for public comment, and assessed by the Commission for consistency with applicable Exchange Act standards, including whether they are reasonable and equitably allocated,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz150-5" NAME="fr_pz150-5">1739</a> and not unfairly discriminatory.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AUebu" NAME="fr_AUebu">1740</a></p>

The commenter expressed concern that the Plan does not explain how much the Participants would charge per message or per market share percentage, or how they would assign the fixed-fee tiers to exchanges and Industry Members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz154-4" NAME="fr_pz154-4">1760</a></p>
          <p id="d0f84122-62c5-48d3-92c8-f94489247753">This commenter also noted that the CAT NMS Plan does not distinguish between costs of the CAT that are related to Industry Member data collection and processing, and costs of the CAT related to SRO surveillance and research, and expressed the view that allocating CAT costs simply based on message traffic or market share would make Industry Members subsidize Participant surveillance systems and other regulatory functions that currently are funded by the Participants through other regulatory fees imposed on Industry Members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz154-5" NAME="fr_pz154-5">1761</a> Finally, this commenter stated that the CAT NMS Plan does not explain why the SROs propose to allocate costs by message-traffic tiers for non-ATS Industry Members and by market share for exchanges and ATSs, and expressed concern that the market share approach applicable to exchanges and ATSs is primarily driven by their ability to pay, as opposed to the actual costs they impose on the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz154-6" NAME="fr_pz154-6">1762</a></p>
          <p id="36ed5748-1c15-4322-8c7d-6ce3b1a27392">Another commenter expressed the view that the proposed allocation of fees among Participants, other types of Execution Venues and Industry Members is not fair,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-3" NAME="fr_pz155-3">1763</a> and that assessing fees based on message traffic and market share is not appropriate or reasonable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-4" NAME="fr_pz155-4">1764</a> This commenter stated that charging for message traffic would amount to a &#8220;financial transaction tax&#8221; that would negatively impact the financial markets, and recommended that charges instead be based on &#8220;quarantine or red-flag of suspicious trade messages.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-5" NAME="fr_pz155-5">1765</a></p>
          <p id="32010a14-a9f1-463f-b544-e4d61cf80a0e">In response, the Participants explained that &#8220;[i]n designing a funding model, the Participants have sought to ensure an equitable allocation of fees such that large broker-dealers or broker-dealer complexes and large Participants or Participant complexes pay more than small broker-dealers and small exchanges.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-6" NAME="fr_pz155-6">1766</a> The Participants believe that there is a strong correlation between message traffic and the size of an Industry Member, and that Industry Members increase their message traffic volume as they grow.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-7" NAME="fr_pz155-7">1767</a> The Participants stated that message traffic is a key component of the costs of operating the CAT, so they believe that message traffic is an appropriate criterion for placing Industry Members in a certain fee tier.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAEO4c" NAME="fr_pAEO4c">1768</a> The Participants also expressed the view that the correlation between message traffic and size does not apply to Execution Venues, which they describe as producing similar amounts of message traffic regardless of size. They explained that charging Execution Venues based on message traffic would make large and small Execution Venues pay comparable fees, which they believe would be an inequitable result,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-3" NAME="fr_pz156-3">1769</a> so the Participants decided to treat Execution Venues differently from Industry Members in the funding model.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-4" NAME="fr_pz156-4">1770</a> The Participants estimated that the result of the funding model would be that fees for the smallest Execution Venues would be comparable to the largest Industry Members, and that aggregate fees for Participant complexes<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-5" NAME="fr_pz156-5">1771</a> would be at least comparable to those of large Industry Members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-6" NAME="fr_pz156-6">1772</a></p>
          <p id="c9c4c858-4a8c-46af-b6f5-03a8c9e335f6">In response to the commenter that stated that the funding model should distinguish between the costs of Industry Member data collection and processing and the costs related to SRO surveillance and research,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-7" NAME="fr_pz156-7">1773</a> and to the commenter that recommended that fees be based on suspicious trade messages,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AaST" NAME="fr_AaST">1774</a> the Participants noted that the Bidders cited data ingestion and processing as the primary driver of CAT costs and thus believe that data collection and processing requirements are a reasonable basis for allocating costs to CAT Reporters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AK-rZ" NAME="fr_AK-rZ">1775</a> As to concerns that a fee based on message traffic would discourage the display of quotes,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgVq" NAME="fr_pAgVq">1776</a> the Participants explained that &#8220;one of the reasons for proposing a tiered, fixed fee funding model was to limit the disincentives to providing liquidity to the market,&#8221; as might be the case with a strictly variable funding model.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-3" NAME="fr_pz157-3">1777</a></p>
          <p id="d961cbd7-ab56-40d7-b82e-9b58d3c8da8c">The Commission expressed concern in the Notice that the structure of the funding model could provide a competitive advantage to exchanges over ATSs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-4" NAME="fr_pz157-4">1778</a> Under the proposed funding model, for an execution occurring on an exchange, the exchange would pay an Execution Venue fee based on its market share to the CAT. For an execution that occurs on an ATS, the Industry Member operating the ATS would pay an Execution Venue fee based on its market share<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-5" NAME="fr_pz157-5">1779</a> and the national securities association also would pay an Execution Venue fee based on its market share when the ATS trade is reported to it.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz157-6" NAME="fr_pz157-6">1780</a> In the Notice, the Commission expressed concern that, under the Plan, ATS volume would effectively be charged once to the Industry Member operating the ATS and a second time to FINRA, which would result in ATS volumes contributing twice as much to CAT funding as exchange volumes. The Commission further inquired whether the funding model would disadvantage ATSs relative to registered exchanges, and whether trading volume could migrate to exchanges in response.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz158-4" NAME="fr_pz158-4">1781</a></p>
          <p id="e638e4fa-8b70-470e-9fc6-b39d957f768c">To address this concern, the Participants recommended modifying the proposed funding model to exclude from the charges applicable to a national securities association any market share attributable to transactions reported to it by an ATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgvdJ" NAME="fr_pAgvdJ">1782</a></p>
          <p id="7f34fdfe-cffe-48aa-b5af-ff954fdf1077">The Commission finds reasonable the suggested modification to the funding model by the Participants and, accordingly, is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article XI - Funding of the Company, Recovery">Section 11.3(a)(i)</a> of the CAT NMS Plan so that the share volume of trades in NMS Stocks or OTC Equity Securities reported by an ATS to a national securities association shall not be included in the calculation of the national securities association&#8217;s market share for purposes of determining its Execution Venue fee. The Commission believes this amendment helps to mitigate concerns that this aspect of the proposed funding model, by effectively double-counting ATS transactions, would result in an inequitable allocation of fees, unfair discrimination and an unnecessary burden on competition.</p>
          <p id="7ce7c2ac-6960-49f5-b0b6-ccd1735c3eb5">With this change, the Commission believes that the funding model set forth in the CAT NMS Plan is reasonable. The Participants have offered a credible justification for using different criteria to charge Execution Venues (market share) and Industry Members (message traffic). The Participants also have offered a reasonable basis for establishing a funding model based on broad tiers, in that it may be easier to implement and less likely to have an incremental deterrent effect on liquidity provision.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-3" NAME="fr_pz159-3">1783</a></p>
          <p id="5f1f8021-cef9-4466-9247-0495f4cda729">In response to concerns that the funding model could make Industry Members subsidize Participant surveillance systems and functions that currently are funded through regulatory fees on Industry Members,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-4" NAME="fr_pz159-4">1784</a> the Commission reiterates that the Exchange Act permits the Participants to assess fees among their members to recoup their regulatory costs, as long as such fees meet the applicable Exchange Act standards, including that they be reasonable and equitably allocated,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-5" NAME="fr_pz159-5">1785</a> and are not unfairly discriminatory.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-6" NAME="fr_pz159-6">1786</a> When such fee proposals are filed with the Commission, they will be published for public comment,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAWEfC" NAME="fr_pAWEfC">1787</a> and the Commission will have the opportunity to assess the fees.</p>

        <p id="d45605ad-7546-4384-b89a-641f23982f51">The Commission believes that it is important that the CAT keep pace with technological developments and changes to industry business practices, which can occur very rapidly. As such, the Commission believes that assessments more frequent than biannually of the CAT&#8217;s standards and processes could ensure that the Plan Processor and the Participants remain current in their knowledge of technological and business developments and facilitate enhancements to the CAT as appropriate. The Commission believes that the preparation of reports and assessments on an annual basis, rather than a biannual basis, will help ensure that CAT technology and operations continue to provide timely, accurate, complete and accessible data, and that it is collected in a cost-effective manner. Accordingly, the Commission is amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Written Assessments, Audits and Reports">Section 6.6</a> of the Plan to change the frequency of the assessment contemplated by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(b)(6)</a> from biannual to annual.</p>
        <p id="a3025937-5fba-41bb-a704-e8f5059f7579">The Commission is also amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Written Assessments, Audits and Reports">Section 6.6</a> of the Plan to provide further detail regarding elements of the written assessment to be conducted by the Participants. Specifically, as amended, the Participants&#8217; annual written assessment must also include: (1) an evaluation of the information security program of the CAT to ensure that the program is consistent with the highest industry standards for protection of data;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz167-3" NAME="fr_pz167-3">1822</a> (2) an evaluation of potential technological upgrades based upon a review of technological developments over the preceding year, drawing on necessary technological expertise, whether internal or external;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz167-4" NAME="fr_pz167-4">1823</a> (3) an assessment of efforts to reduce the time to restore and recover CAT Data at a back-up site;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz167-5" NAME="fr_pz167-5">1824</a> (4) an assessment of how the Plan Processor and SROs are monitoring Error Rates and addresses the application of Error Rates based on product, data element or other criteria; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz167-6" NAME="fr_pz167-6">1825</a> (5) a copy of the evaluation required by <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(c)</a> of the Plan as to whether industry standards have evolved such that: (i) the clock synchronization standard in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(a)</a> should be shortened; or (ii) the required timestamp in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(b)</a> should be in finer increments; and (6) an assessment of whether any data elements should be added, deleted or changed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAyMDJ" NAME="fr_pAyMDJ">1826</a> The Commission believes that requiring these specific issues to be addressed in the Participants&#8217; annual assessment will focus the Plan Processor and Participants on critical technological and other developments, and should help ensure that CAT technology is up-to-date, resilient and secure, and provides accurate CAT Data.</p>
        <p id="5fdbd0fc-5599-4314-a2fe-fbc45a03c831"><a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Written Assessments, Audits and Reports">Section 6.6</a> of the Plan as filed also requires the Participants to provide an estimate of the costs associated with any potential improvements to the performance of the CAT, including an assessment of the potential impact on competition, efficiency and capital formation. The Commission believes, however, that it is important that the Participants consider not just the costs but also the potential benefits associated with any improvements to the performance of the CAT, including the impact on investor protection. Accordingly, the Commission is also amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Written Assessments, Audits and Reports">Section 6.6</a> of the Plan to require the annual assessment to consider the benefits of potential improvements to the CAT, including to investor protection.</p>
        <p id="f89d6d0c-fa81-437e-9f50-f0e28f3bdc0d">The Commission is further amending <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Written Assessments, Audits and Reports">Section 6.6</a> of the Plan to require that the Participants provide the Commission with certain written reports on a one-time basis. First, the Participants must provide the Commission, and make public, at least one month prior to submitting any rule filing to establish initial fees for CAT Reporters, an independent audit of the fees, costs, and expenses incurred by the Participants on behalf of the Company prior to the Effective Date of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz168-4" NAME="fr_pz168-4">1827</a> The Commission notes that any such filing will be published for public notice and comment. As the Commission understands that the Participants intend to recover through CAT fees the amounts spent on the development of the CAT to date, to facilitate public comment and Commission review of such fee filings,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgmIn" NAME="fr_pAgmIn">1828</a> the Commission believes it is appropriate for the Participants to obtain an audit of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Participants on behalf of the Company prior to the Effective Date.</p>
        <p id="23b13483-c50a-4b20-bb99-9e5702eab297">Second, the Commission is amending the Plan to require the Participants to provide the Commission with a written assessment of the clock synchronization standards in the Plan<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgmIn" NAME="fr_pAgmIn">1829</a> within six months of effectiveness of the Plan. As noted above, the Commission believes that the Participants should consider the type of CAT Reporter, the type of Industry Member, and type of system when determining industry standards, and is amending the Plan to clarify this more granular approach. The Commission believes the Participants should consider the Plan&#8217;s clock synchronization standards in light of this clarification promptly, and propose any appropriate amendments, and that a six-month timeframe to do so is reasonable.</p>
        <p id="7c501834-1c46-4487-a274-1969228caffb">Third, the Commission is amending the Plan to require the Participants to provide the Commission with a written report that discusses the Participants&#8217; assessment of implementing coordinated surveillance, whether through 17d-2 agreements, RSAs, or some other approach, within 12 months of effectiveness of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz169-4" NAME="fr_pz169-4">1830</a> The Commission notes that the CAT is designed to facilitate the ability of regulators to conduct cross-market surveillances and to review conduct that occurs across the market. As a result, the Commission believes that it may be efficient for the Participants to coordinate to conduct cross-market surveillances.</p>
        <p id="990789de-9c66-4936-843f-57cda7570acc">Fourth, the Commission is amending the Plan to require the Participants to submit to the Commission a written report, within 24 months of effectiveness of the Plan, discussing the feasibility, benefits, and risks of allowing an Industry Member to bulk download the Raw Data that it has submitted to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz169-5" NAME="fr_pz169-5">1831</a> Commenters expressed a desire to have bulk access to their own data for surveillance and internal compliance purposes, as well as to facilitate the error correction process. While, the Participants did not permit such access in the Plan, citing security and cost concerns, they did represent that they would consider allowing bulk access to the audit trail data reported by Industry Members once CAT is operational. The Commission believes it is important to consider the potential efficiencies of allowing Industry Members bulk access to their own CAT data, so long as such access does not impact the security of the CAT Data, and accordingly believes that requiring a report discussing this issue by the date Industry Members first begin reporting to the CAT, is appropriate.</p>
        <p id="eb565d79-1989-4a86-91d8-1d93491dd9af">Fifth, the Commission is amending the Plan to require the Participants to provide the Commission with a written assessment, within 36 months of effectiveness of the Plan, of the nature and extent of errors in the Customer information submitted to the Central Repository and whether the correction of certain data fields over others should be prioritized.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz170-4" NAME="fr_pz170-4">1832</a> The Commission believes that requiring such an assessment, which will coincide with the date all Industry Members are reporting to the CAT, could help ensure that the accuracy of CAT Data is achieved in the most prompt and efficient manner.</p>
        <p id="65b8a572-cb6c-42fa-87c4-6b5fba6be327">Sixth, the Commission is amending the Plan to require the Participants to provide the Commission with a written report, 36 months after effectiveness of the Plan, on the impact of tiered fees on market liquidity, including an analysis of the impact of the tiered-fee structure on Industry Members&#8217; provision of liquidity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAZTfA" NAME="fr_pAZTfA">1833</a> One commenter expressed concern that use of a tiered fee structure could discourage displayed quotes and, in response, the Participants explained that one of the reasons they chose to use a tiered-fee funding model was to limit disincentives to provide liquidity. To help determine whether the Plan&#8217;s funding model actually achieves the Participants&#8217; stated objective, the Commission believes it appropriate to require them to prepare such an assessment of the impact of tiered fees once the CAT becomes fully operational.</p>
        <p id="e1386abf-5265-444d-a491-c991b7e666ae">Finally, the Commission is amending the Plan to require the Participants to provide the Commission a written assessment of the projected impact of any Material Systems Change on the Maximum Error Rate, prior to the implementation of any Material Systems Change.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz171-6" NAME="fr_pz171-6">1834</a> The Commission believes that Material Systems Changes either could result in new challenges for CAT Reporters or simplify the means for reporting data. In either case, the appropriateness of the Maximum Error Rate could be impacted, and thus warrant a change. Accordingly, the Commission believes it appropriate to require the Participants to provide the Commission an assessment of the projected impact on the Maximum Error Rate, including any recommended changes thereto, prior to the implementation of any Material Systems Change.</p>

        <p id="e1988b58-d52e-4f19-a76a-6d89690c6f17">The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects of the CAT NMS Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAThz" NAME="fr_pAThz">1835</a> including its costs and benefits and its impact on efficiency, competition and capital formation. In accordance with the approach articulated by the Commission in the Adopting Release, the Commission published its preliminary economic analysis of the CAT NMS Plan in the Notice, and solicited comment on its analysis and on all aspects of the proposed Plan. The Commission has considered the comments received, along with the Participants&#8217; responses, and has modified certain aspects of the Plan, as discussed above.</p>
        <p id="c022a25f-e964-4ec6-b517-52d83aef9815">This Section reflects the Commission&#8217;s analysis and conclusions regarding the economic effects of the creation, implementation and maintenance of the CAT pursuant to the details in the CAT NMS Plan, as amended and hereby approved by the Commission. The analysis is divided into seven topics: (1) a summary of the expected economic effects of approving the CAT NMS Plan; (2) a description of the economic framework for analyzing the economic effects of approving the CAT NMS Plan; (3) a discussion of the current, or &#8220;Baseline,&#8221; audit trail data available to regulators, and the sources of such data; (4) a discussion of the potential benefits of approving the CAT NMS Plan; (5) a discussion of the potential costs of approving the CAT NMS Plan; (6) a discussion of the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s potential impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation; and (7) a discussion of alternatives to various features of the CAT NMS Plan and to the CAT NMS Plan itself.</p>

        <p id="e7c1e780-2906-44c7-ab65-2d70738bb3be">The Commission has analyzed the expected economic effects of the CAT NMS Plan in light of the existing shortcomings in the regulatory data infrastructure and the goal of improving the ability of SROs and the Commission to perform their regulatory activities to the benefit of investors and the markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz172-5" NAME="fr_pz172-5">1836</a> In general, the Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan will result in benefits by improving the quality of the data available to regulators in four areas that affect the ultimate effectiveness of core regulatory efforts&#8212;completeness, accuracy, accessibility and timeliness.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz172-6" NAME="fr_pz172-6">1837</a> The Commission believes that the improvements in these data qualities that will be realized from approval of the CAT NMS Plan will substantially improve regulators&#8217; ability to perform analysis and reconstruction of market events, market analysis and research to inform policy decisions, and other regulatory activities including market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions. Regulators depend on data for many of these activities and the improvements in the data qualities will thus improve the efficiency and effectiveness of such regulatory activities. As explained further below, these improvements could benefit investors by giving regulators more and better regulatory tools to provide investors with a more effectively regulated trading environment,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-3" NAME="fr_pz173-3">1838</a> which could increase capital formation, liquidity, and price efficiency. Data improvements could enhance regulators&#8217; ability to provide investors and the public with more timely and accurate analysis and reconstruction of market events, and to develop more effective responses to such events. Improved understanding of emerging market issues resulting from enhanced market analysis and research could inform regulatory policies that improve investor protection through better market quality, more transparency, and more efficient prices. Improvements in quality and quantity of order events could lead to improvements in developing and targeting policy approaches to ensure a fair and orderly market.</p>
        <p id="5ec7ab2c-c51c-4570-a97d-ffe23b6ddacf">In terms of completeness, the Plan requires the reporting of certain additional data fields, events, and products.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-4" NAME="fr_pz173-4">1839</a> More importantly, the CAT NMS Plan requires data elements useful for regulatory analysis to be available from a single data source. Having relevant data elements available from a single source will simplify and expedite regulators&#8217; data collection process and facilitate more efficient analyses and surveillances that incorporate cross-market and cross-product data.</p>
        <p id="522d4936-7bf6-416e-aab3-9ef7a88b4513">With respect to the accuracy of available data, the Commission believes that the requirements in the Plan will improve data accuracy significantly. For example, the Commission expects that the requirements to store the CAT Data in a uniform linked format and the use of consistent identifiers for customers and market participants will result in fewer inaccuracies as compared to current data sources. These accuracy improvements should significantly reduce the time regulators spend processing the data and finding solutions when faced with inaccurate data. The Commission believes that the requirements in the Plan for clock synchronization and timestamp granularity will improve the accuracy of data with respect to the timing of market events. The Commission believes that the Plan will improve regulators&#8217; ability to determine the sequence of some market events relative to all surrounding events.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-3" NAME="fr_pz174-3">1840</a></p>
        <p id="70176c75-7f8c-43ad-abd4-3fe8d5fa84d9">The Commission also believes that the Plan will increase the accessibility of data for SROs and the Commission, because regulators will be able to access the CAT Data directly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-4" NAME="fr_pz174-4">1841</a> This, coupled with the improvements in completeness, will vastly increase the scope of information readily available to regulators and significantly reduce the number of data requests from the several hundred thousand requests regulators make each year. The increased scope of readily available information should facilitate more data-driven regulatory policy decisions, broaden the potential surveillances, expand the opportunities for SRO and Commission analysis to help target broker-dealers and investment advisers for examinations and help to perform those examinations.</p>
        <p id="a5455506-b2cb-4201-8d0d-6cc538026f63">Finally, the Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan will improve the timeliness of available data. Because regulators will be able to access uncorrected data the day after an order event and will be able to access corrected and linked data five days after an order event,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-3" NAME="fr_pz175-3">1842</a> many data elements will be available to regulators more quickly than they are currently. Accordingly, the amount of time regulators would need to acquire and process data before running analyses would be reduced. For example, the corrected and linked data available on T+5 will identify the customer account associated with all order events, information that currently takes ten days or longer for regulators to obtain and then need to link to other data sources for use. These improvements in timeliness, combined with improvements in completeness, accessibility, and accuracy discussed above, will improve the efficiency of regulatory analysis and reconstruction of market events, as well as market analysis and research that informs policy decisions, and make market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions more efficient, allowing, for example, the SROs and the Commission to review tips and complaints more effectively.</p>
        <p id="be548624-7980-4541-b071-5a31a37f67f4">The Commission notes that the Plan lacks information regarding the details of certain elements of the Plan likely to affect the costs and benefits associated with it, primarily because those details have not yet been determined, and this lack of information creates some uncertainty about the expected economic effects. As discussed further below, lack of specificity surrounding the processes for converting data formats and linking related order events creates uncertainty as to the anticipated improvements in accuracy because such processes have the potential to create new data inaccuracies. Lack of specificity surrounding the process for regulators to access the CAT Data also creates uncertainty around the expected improvements in accessibility. For example, while the Plan indicates that regulators would have an online targeted query tool and a tool for user-defined direct queries or bulk extraction,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz176-4" NAME="fr_pz176-4">1843</a> the Plan itself does not provide an indication for how user-friendly the tools would be or the particular skill set needed to use the tools for user-defined direct queries. However, the Commission has analyzed the expected economic effects of the Plan to the extent possible with the information available, noting areas of uncertainty in its analysis where applicable. The Commission has also considered whether certain provisions related to the operation and administration of the Plan could mitigate some of the uncertainties.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAZf7i" NAME="fr_pAZf7i">1844</a></p>
        <p id="60dc82f7-e292-4b6f-8c3b-662a70beb48c">The Commission also believes that more effective and efficient regulation of securities markets and market participants resulting from implementation of the CAT NMS Plan could significantly benefit investors and the integrity of the market. For example, the Commission believes that more effective and efficient surveillance and enforcement should detect a higher proportion of violative market activity. This additional detection could not only reduce violative behavior through potential enforcement actions, but through deterrence if market participants believe violative activities are more likely to be detected. Because violative activity degrades market quality and imposes costs on investors and market participants, reductions in violative activity would benefit investors and market integrity. Likewise, more effective and efficient risk assessment and risk-based examinations should facilitate the selection of market participants for examination who have characteristics that elevate their risk of violating the rules. Decreasing the amount of violative activity by targeting exams in this way should provide investors with a more effectively regulated trading environment and hence better market quality. Further, access to audit trail data that is comprehensive, accurate, and timely should improve regulatory reconstruction of market events, market analysis, and research, resulting in an improved understanding of emerging market issues and regulatory policies that better encourage industry competition, thus improving investor protection through better transparency and more efficient prices.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAH-P" NAME="fr_pAH-P">1845</a> Regulatory initiatives that are based on a more thorough understanding of underlying events and their causes, and that are narrowly tailored to address any market deficiency, should improve market quality and benefit investors. Access to more complete and linked audit trail data will improve regulators&#8217; ability to analyze and reconstruct market events, allowing regulators to provide investors and the public with more accurate explanations of market events, to develop more effective responses to such events, and to use the information to assist in retrospective analyses of their rules and pilots.</p>
        <p id="ae55273e-26c5-4047-992f-3e9b4088de43">The Commission has also evaluated the potential costs that will result from the approval of the CAT NMS Plan. The Commission&#8217;s cost analysis is based on the preliminary analysis in the Notice, which analyzed information included in the Plan, information gathered from market participants through discussions, surveys of market participants, and other relevant information to estimate the potential costs associated with building and maintaining the Central Repository as well as the costs to report data to the Central Repository. The Commission has considered the comments received on its preliminary analysis, the Participants&#8217; response to the comments, and the impact of the Commission&#8217;s modifications to the Plan and has revised its analysis and estimates accordingly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz178-2" NAME="fr_pz178-2">1846</a> Currently, the 21 Participants spend $170.3 million annually on reporting regulatory data and performing surveillance, while the approximately 1,800 broker-dealers anticipated to have CAT reporting responsibilities spend $1.6 billion annually on regulatory data reporting, for total current industry costs of $1.7 billion annually for regulatory data reporting and surveillance by SROs. Having considered the comments, the Participants&#8217; response and the Commission&#8217;s modifications to the Plan, the Commission now estimates the cost of the Plan as approximately $2.4 billion in initial aggregate implementation costs and recurring annual costs of $1.7 billion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz178-3" NAME="fr_pz178-3">1847</a> Furthermore, the Commission acknowledges that during the period of duplicative reporting, during which CAT Reporters will report to both current regulatory data reporting systems and CAT, industry will face duplicative reporting costs that the Commission estimates at $1.7 billion per year, the cost of industry&#8217;s current data reporting.</p>
        <p id="3d6fefb1-eecb-494e-b3b2-7fe0e9782294">Commenters had numerous comments on individual estimates of costs, particularly as they related to requirements to report allocation timestamps in milliseconds, the costs of duplicative reporting, and generally about the uncertainty surrounding cost estimates. The primary driver of the annual costs is the data reporting cost for broker-dealers, which is estimated to be $1.5 billion per year. For both large and small broker-dealers, the primary driver of both the current $1.6 billion reporting costs and projected $1.5 billion CAT reporting costs is costs associated with staffing. Bidder estimates of the costs to build the Central Repository vary from $37.5 million to $65 million and annual operating costs range from $36.5 to $55 million. The eventual magnitude of Central Repository costs depends on the Participants&#8217; selection of the Plan Processor, and may ultimately differ from estimates discussed above if Bids are revised as the bidding process progresses. Furthermore, the Plan anticipates a period of duplicative reporting responsibilities preceding the retirement of potentially duplicative regulatory data reporting systems; these duplicative reporting costs are likely to be significant.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz179-3" NAME="fr_pz179-3">1848</a></p>
        <p id="db24cab4-a6d4-4c60-a9b9-bae7d92bc8d0">Drawing from the discussion in the CAT NMS Plan, the comments received, and the Participants&#8217; response to the comments,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz179-4" NAME="fr_pz179-4">1849</a> the Commission expects that the Plan will have a number of additional economic effects, including effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The Commission believes that the Plan generally promotes competition. However, the Commission recognizes that the Plan could increase barriers to entry because of the costs to comply with the Plan. Further, the Commission&#8217;s analysis identifies several limiting factors to competition; however, Plan provisions and Commission oversight could mitigate such limiting factors. The Commission believes that the Plan will result in significant improvements in efficiency related to how regulatory data is collected and used. Specifically, the approval of the Plan will result in improved data becoming available to regulators, which will increase the efficiency of regulatory activities such as market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions that could enhance market efficiency by reducing violative activity that harms market efficiency. In addition, the availability of this data should improve regulatory analysis and reconstruction of market events, as well as market analysis and research that informs policy decisions. Finally, the Commission believes that the Plan could have positive effects on capital formation and allocative efficiency and that the threat of a security breach at the Central Repository is unlikely to significantly harm capital formation. The Commission recognizes that the Plan&#8217;s likely effects on competition, efficiency and capital formation are dependent to some extent on the performance and decisions of the Plan Processor and the Operating Committee in implementing the Plan, and thus there is necessarily some uncertainty in the Commission&#8217;s analysis. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that the Plan contains certain governance provisions, as well as provisions relating to the selection and removal of the Plan Processor, that mitigate this uncertainty by promoting decision-making that could, on balance, have positive effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.</p>
        <p id="f3b2167c-25f3-4e09-8cf0-ae1c4d94a07b">As part of its economic analysis, the Commission has also considered the likely economic effects of a number of alternatives to the approaches taken in the CAT NMS Plan. The Commission has analyzed certain alternatives that could have a direct and significant impact on costs or benefits deriving from at least one of the four data qualities discussed above: accuracy, completeness, accessibility, and timeliness. This analysis includes alternatives proposed by commenters.</p>

          <p id="a8ccb66e-1cb6-4ac5-918f-8298ad4d0b35">The CAT NMS Plan will create a new data source that should modernize and eventually replace the use of some disparate current data sources for many regulatory activities. As such, the economic benefits of the CAT NMS Plan will come from any expanded and more efficient regulatory activities facilitated by improvements to the data regulators use. Therefore, the framework for examining benefits in this economic analysis involves first considering whether and to what degree the CAT Data will improve on the Baseline of current trading and order data in terms of the four qualities of accuracy, completeness, accessibility, and timeliness.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz182-3" NAME="fr_pz182-3">1855</a></p>
          <p id="ad5d405d-a093-4787-9aa3-8573b5b34568">Through these improvements in the data, the economic analysis then considers the degree to which the Plan will result in improvements to regulatory activities such as the analysis and reconstruction of market events, in addition to market analysis and research conducted by SROs and Commission Staff, as well as market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions. These potential improvements, based on the regulatory objectives of the CAT NMS Plan described in the Adopting Release,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA2b2" NAME="fr_pA2b2">1856</a> relate to the overall goal of substantially enhancing the ability of the SROs and the Commission to oversee securities markets and fulfill their regulatory responsibilities under the securities laws. The economic framework explores how the improvements to these regulatory activities provide economic benefits to investors and the market. Among other things, potential benefits that could result from the CAT NMS Plan include benefits rooted in changes in the behavior of market participants. For example, requirements to report certain data elements or events to the CAT could have the beneficial effect of detecting and deterring rule violations because the inclusion of certain data fields and improvements in the ability to surveil for violations could increase the perceived costs of violating rules and regulations. Potential benefits could also stem from improved investor protection, such as from more effective surveillance and more informed, data-driven rulemaking. In addition, potential benefits could stem from future reduced costs due to more targeted, data-driven policy choices.</p>
          <p id="5a318a0f-cae2-446e-a57e-6834d94507df">(1) Data Qualities</p>
          <p id="3af5fc1a-181f-4438-817d-a64100703edb">In assessing the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission&#8217;s economic analysis compares the data that will be available under the Plan to the trading and order data currently available to regulators to determine whether and to what degree the Plan will improve the available data with respect to the four qualities of accuracy, completeness, accessibility, and timeliness. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz183-8" NAME="fr_pz183-8">1857</a></p>
          <p id="b1f67550-6dfb-4a5c-9d1e-058063e8d6e0">(2) Regulatory Activities</p>
          <p id="26a286ef-0373-40d3-aa22-13fd67062e19">Any economic benefits will derive from how such improved data will affect regulatory activities. Therefore, to analyze the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan, the economic analysis also evaluates the potential of the CAT NMS Plan to meet the regulatory objectives set out in the Adopting Release for <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. The objectives are: improvements in the analysis and reconstruction of broad-based market events; improvements in market analysis in support of regulatory decisions; and improvements in market surveillance, investigations, and other enforcement activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-6" NAME="fr_pz184-6">1858</a></p>

          <p id="d7445e9e-d0da-487a-9b43-65c58db0ed7d">The economic analysis considers whether and to what extent the CAT NMS Plan will facilitate regulators&#8217; performance of analysis and reconstruction of market events, potentially helping to better inform both regulators and investors about such market events and speeding the regulatory response following market events. Regulators perform reconstructions of market events so that they and the public can be informed by an accurate accounting of what happened (and, possibly, why it happened). As discussed in the Benefits Section,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-7" NAME="fr_pz184-7">1859</a> market reconstructions currently can take a significant amount of time, in large measure due to various deficiencies in the currently available trading and order data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-8" NAME="fr_pz184-8">1860</a> The sooner regulators complete a reconstruction and analysis of a market event, the sooner investors can be informed and the sooner regulators can begin reviewing the event to determine what happened, who was affected and how, and whether the analysis supports potential regulatory responses.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAakC9" NAME="fr_pAakC9">1861</a> In addition, the improved ability for regulators to generate prompt and complete market reconstructions could provide improved market knowledge, which could assist regulators in conducting retrospective analysis of their rules and pilots.</p>
          <p id="58bbf004-ab33-4686-8136-53aecbb82e75">B. Market Analysis in Support of Regulatory Decisions</p>
          <p id="8b359ed5-fbd4-4c06-a0fd-937e9caf736e">The economic analysis considers whether and to what extent the CAT NMS Plan will enhance the ability of the SROs and the Commission to conduct market analysis and research, including analysis of market structure, and the degree to which it will improve regulators&#8217; market knowledge and facilitate consideration of policy questions of interest. The SROs and Commission Staff conduct data-driven analysis on market structure, in direct support of both rulemaking and other regulatory decisions such as SRO rule approvals. The Commission also relies on such analysis to improve understanding of market structure in ways that could inform policy. Finally, SROs conduct market analysis and research on their own regulatory initiatives. Improvements in the ability to conduct market analysis could further improve analysis related to regulatory decisions and potentially influence those regulatory decisions to the benefit of investors and the markets more generally.</p>
          <p id="4abdffe2-a50c-4472-a11c-b5663365df90">C. Market Surveillance and Investigations</p>
          <p id="7024075c-1600-48b6-a431-f784789c93f3">The economic analysis examines whether the CAT NMS Plan will improve market surveillance and investigations, potentially resulting in more effective oversight of trading, better investor protection, and deterrence of violative behavior. As described in more detail in the Baseline Section,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz185-4" NAME="fr_pz185-4">1862</a> both SROs and the Commission conduct market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions targeting illegal activities such as insider trading, wash sales, or manipulative practices. Improvements in market surveillance and investigations could come in the form of &#8220;facilitating risk-based examinations, allowing more accurate and faster surveillance for manipulation, improving the process for evaluating tips, complaints, and referrals . . ., and promoting innovation in cross-market and principal order surveillance.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz186-6" NAME="fr_pz186-6">1863</a></p>
          <p id="894f96df-208d-4ec2-8c65-464bc6ddacf4">b. Costs</p>
          <p id="371f28b8-0046-40da-9d42-e4170dfbc89b">The economic analysis evaluates the costs of building and operating the Central Repository; the costs of CAT reporting for Participants, broker-dealers, and service bureaus; and other CAT-related costs. Where the CAT NMS Plan provides estimates of these costs, the economic analysis evaluates those estimates and re-estimates them when necessary. The economic analysis also discusses the drivers of these costs, and whether broker-dealers may or may not pass these costs down to their customers. As a part of its consideration of the costs of the CAT NMS Plan, the economic analysis considers costs from duplicative reporting for some period of time as well as potential cost savings from the retirement of duplicative regulatory reporting systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz186-7" NAME="fr_pz186-7">1864</a></p>
          <p id="61dc3f1d-1aae-4d16-a49f-7ab34cbbe936">The economic analysis also considers whether the CAT NMS Plan could result in second order effects, such as changes to the behavior of market participants, that impose certain costs. For example, the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s tiered funding model could lead to efforts by market participants to try to control their tiers in order to affect their fee payments, such as reducing activity levels near the end of an activity level measuring period to avoid being classified as a higher activity level firm. In addition, Participants, their members, and investors could incur costs if their private information were accessed in the event of a security breach of the Central Repository. The economic analysis considers these and other elements of the Plan that could lead to distortions in behavior by market participants.</p>

          <p id="96757636-055f-484c-9038-fb115c250cfd">In the Notice, the Commission described how it analyzed the information in the CAT NMS Plan, as well as other relevant data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz187-6" NAME="fr_pz187-6">1865</a> in order to assess the economic effects of the Plan. As discussed throughout the analysis in the Notice, in certain cases the Commission lacked information needed to evaluate all of the potential economic effects of the CAT NMS Plan, creating uncertainty in some potential benefits and costs. The primary drivers of uncertainty included the fee schedule applicable to funding the Central Repository (the &#8220;Funding Model&#8221;), which has not yet been finalized, the deferral of decisions on certain discretionary elements including the Technical Specifications applicable to the CAT, and a lack of detailed information that would enable the Commission to assess certain economic effects with greater precision.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz187-7" NAME="fr_pz187-7">1866</a> The Notice discussed implications of each primary area of uncertainty.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA4JpA" NAME="fr_pA4JpA">1867</a></p>
          <p id="2cc8f4ac-276b-4fbd-aad4-31436c9006ef">First, the economic analysis in the Notice evaluated information provided in the CAT NMS Plan on the economic effects of the Plan, as well as information drawn from outside of the Plan. However, the Commission lacked detailed information regarding some of the individual costs and discretionary decisions in the Plan, including the Funding Model. Specifically, the Plan does not outline the proportion of CAT costs that will be allocated to Participants versus broker-dealers. This uncertainty limited the Commission&#8217;s ability to evaluate the economic effects of the Plan in some cases. However, the Commission analyzed the expected economic effects of the Plan to the extent possible with the information available, and where the Commission identified such areas of uncertainty, the economic analysis addressed this uncertainty.</p>
          <p id="ec887851-9486-4105-bda5-0a0230c528c5">Second, the Commission pointed out that certain elements of the CAT NMS Plan will not be finalized until after the selection of a &#8220;Plan Processor.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz188-3" NAME="fr_pz188-3">1868</a> Among these are the security and confidentiality procedures of the Central Repository,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz188-4" NAME="fr_pz188-4">1869</a> the precise methods by which regulators will access data in the Central Repository,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz188-5" NAME="fr_pz188-5">1870</a> and the complete Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz188-6" NAME="fr_pz188-6">1871</a> The Plan also provides the Plan Processor the &#8220;sole discretion&#8221; to publish interpretations of the Technical Specifications, including interpretations of permitted values in data elements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pANTu5" NAME="fr_pANTu5">1872</a></p>
          <p id="a3561095-233f-43f8-a031-8beee75c30cb">Because these and other elements of the Plan had not yet been finalized, the Commission could not assess how and to what extent the elements could affect the overall economic effects of the Plan. The Commission&#8217;s economic analysis was therefore limited to the extent that the economic effects of the Plan depend on decisions that will be made after approval of the Plan. However, the Commission identified these areas of uncertainty and assessed the economic effects of the Plan to the best of its ability in light of these existing uncertainties.</p>
          <p id="6b389cb9-93a9-46d1-a6ed-0f1cc85053ce">Given the range of possible outcomes with respect to both the costs and benefits of the CAT NMS Plan that depend on future decisions, the Commission also recognized in the Notice the importance of provisions of the Plan related to the operation and administration of the CAT. In particular, the Commission stated that governance provisions of the Plan related to voting by the Operating Committee and the involvement of the Advisory Committee may help promote better decision-making by the relevant parties. Such provisions could mitigate concerns about potential uncertainty in the economic effects of the Plan by giving the Commission greater confidence that its expected benefits would be achieved in an efficient manner and that costs resulting from inefficiencies will be avoided. Nevertheless, commenters rightly observed that uncertainties remain, and will continue to remain until selection of the Plan Processor, the publication of Technical Specifications, and/or the implementation of CAT reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz189-3" NAME="fr_pz189-3">1873</a></p>
          <p id="492bd7e1-5387-4158-88fe-7c5049923b1b">The Commission has considered the comments it received relevant to the potential uncertainties in its analysis of the economic effects of the CAT NMS Plan, the Participants&#8217; response, and the effect of Plan modifications on such uncertainties and has revised its economic analysis accordingly. Throughout this economic analysis, the Commission recognizes these uncertainties, including the ones raised by commenters. In particular, the economic analysis described below recognizes uncertainties as they relate to the baseline, benefits, and costs and as they relate to the analysis of alternatives, efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In some cases, the Plan modifications and the Participants&#8217; response letters reduce the uncertainty in the Commission&#8217;s analysis. However, the Commission continues to believe that governance provisions of the Plan could mitigate concerns about many of the sources of potential uncertainty in the economic effects of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz190-6" NAME="fr_pz190-6">1874</a></p>

          <p id="610dfe02-41c6-4feb-bcc7-b735327fe1af">As explained in detail in the Notice, regulators perform market surveillance and investigation functions that rely on access to multiple types of market data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz194-8" NAME="fr_pz194-8">1890</a> The following Sections summarize the discussion from the Notice describing the current state of SRO surveillance and SRO and Commission examinations and enforcement investigations.</p>
          <p id="9c0ed472-4915-408a-b5ae-af4f7a4084a5">(1) Current SRO Surveillance</p>
          <p id="928c0fc2-04eb-4674-9d53-ca6aa36cbc15"><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(f)</a> requires the SROs to develop and implement a surveillance system, or enhance existing surveillance systems, reasonably designed to make use of the CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz194-9" NAME="fr_pz194-9">1891</a> For the purposes of the economic analysis in the Notice, the Commission considered surveillance to involve SROs running automated processes on routinely collected or in-house data to identify potential violations of rules or regulations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAfZF" NAME="fr_pAfZF">1892</a> For instance, SROs use surveillance systems, developed internally or by a third party, to detect violations of trading rules, market abuse, or unusual behavior, in real time, within one day, or within a few weeks of the activity in question. As discussed in the Notice, SRO surveillance can help protect investors by detecting fraudulent behavior and anomalous trading.</p>
          <p id="2485b6dc-f9e8-4618-b183-d36b0edf3a6b">Currently, exchange-operating SROs use surveillance systems and are responsible for surveillance of their own market. As discussed in the Notice, FINRA conducts off-exchange and cross-market surveillance<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz195-6" NAME="fr_pz195-6">1893</a> and oversees and regulates OTC trading of exchange-listed and non-exchange-listed securities, as well as trading in corporate and municipal debt instruments and other fixed income instruments. FINRA also provides surveillance services to U.S. equity and options exchanges through regulatory services agreements with nearly every equity market and all options exchanges. Additional surveillance is conducted by exchange-operating SROs and some of this additional surveillance is conducted as trading activity occurs. This surveillance can include detection of market manipulation, violations of trading rules, and other unusual behavior.</p>
          <p id="bfe6bb6e-e762-4456-bdba-7162e9831f29">While there were no explicit comments pertaining to the current practices regarding SRO surveillance, the Participants&#8217; responses confirm that they have real-time surveillance and monitoring tools in place for their respective markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz195-7" NAME="fr_pz195-7">1894</a></p>
          <p id="763a7376-9ac0-4849-b3ce-fec0edaf2f42">(2) Examinations</p>
          <p id="5853ac6a-7367-4943-971b-4ffdc4df95c4">In the Notice, the Commission discussed how regulators currently perform examinations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz195-8" NAME="fr_pz195-8">1895</a> As addressed in detail in the Notice, SROs currently conduct exams of broker-dealers for violations of trading-related federal laws, rules, and regulations and for violations of SRO rules and regulations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAkbJq" NAME="fr_pAkbJq">1896</a> In 2015, FINRA&#8217;s Member Regulation Department conducted approximately 2,400 broker-dealer examinations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz196-2" NAME="fr_pz196-2">1897</a> Currently, the Commission conducts exams of broker-dealers, transfer agents, investment advisers, investment companies, municipal advisers, clearing agencies, the national securities exchanges, other SROs such as FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz196-5" NAME="fr_pz196-5">1898</a> For example, the Commission conducted 493 broker-dealer examinations in 2014 and 484 in 2015, and 70 exams of the national securities exchanges and FINRA in 2014 and 21 in 2015. In addition, the Commission conducted 1,237 investment adviser and investment company examinations in 2014 and 1,358 in 2015. Virtually all investment adviser examinations and a significant proportion of the Commission&#8217;s other examinations involve analysis of trading and order data. Examinations of broker-dealers and investment advisers involve intensive analysis of trading data. Examinations seek to determine whether the entity being examined is: conducting its activities in accordance with the federal securities laws, rules adopted under these laws, and SRO rules; adhering to the disclosures it has made to its clients, customers, the general public, SROs and/or the Commission; and implementing supervisory systems and/or compliance policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the entity&#8217;s operations are in compliance with the applicable legal requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz196-6" NAME="fr_pz196-6">1899</a> In order to select candidates for examination, the Commission and certain SROs, including FINRA,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz197-5" NAME="fr_pz197-5">1900</a> use a risk-based approach. &#8220;Risk-based examinations&#8221; seek to increase regulatory efficiency by using preliminary data analysis to direct examination resources towards entities and activities where risks of violative or illegal activity are the highest. The Commission uses risk and data analysis before opening an exam to identify broker-dealers and investment advisers for areas of focus such as suspicious trading, as well as during an exam to identify the particular activities of a broker-dealer or investment adviser that could trigger certain compliance and supervisory risks.</p>
          <p id="020e7425-785a-45ff-b424-ebdc19649968">(3) Enforcement Investigations</p>
          <p id="197c80b9-9b71-41b2-b9db-fbb3a179dbd6">In the Notice, the Commission discussed how regulators currently approach enforcement investigations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz197-6" NAME="fr_pz197-6">1901</a> As explained in detail in the Notice, the Commission and SROs undertake numerous investigations to enforce the securities laws and related rules and regulations, including investigations of market manipulation, insider trading, and issuer repurchase violations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz197-7" NAME="fr_pz197-7">1902</a> The Commission estimates that 30-50% of enforcement investigations use trade and order data. In 2015, the Commission filed 807 enforcement actions, including 39 related to insider trading, 43 related to market manipulation, 124 related to broker-dealers, 126 related to investment advisers/investment companies, and one related to exchange or SRO duties. In 2014, the Commission filed 755 enforcement actions, including 52 related to insider trading, 63 related to market manipulation, 166 related to broker-dealers, and 130 related to investment advisers/investment companies, many of which involved trade and order data.</p>
          <p id="9d706aea-3dc2-42d3-8906-33ca76c57a3a">The Commission initiates enforcement investigations when SROs or others submit reliable tips, complaints, or referrals, or when the Commission becomes aware of anomalies indicative of manipulation. After the detection of potential anomalies, a tremendous amount of time and resources are expended in gathering and interpreting trade and order data to construct an accurate picture of when trades were actually executed, what market conditions were in effect at the time of the trade, which traders participated in the trade, and which beneficial owners were affected by the trade. The Commission also explained in the Notice that SROs rely primarily on surveillance to initiate investigations based on anomalies in the trading of securities. FINRA brought 1,397 disciplinary actions in 2014 and 1,512 in 2015.</p>
          <p id="e54be609-4ded-4905-96bd-c87d24ac716f">(4) Tips and Complaints</p>
          <p id="959d0b46-40c2-4cbc-aa34-7225ade5a807">In the Notice, the Commission discussed how regulators currently analyze and investigate tips and complaints.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz198-6" NAME="fr_pz198-6">1903</a> Market participants or those with experience in analyzing market data sometimes notice atypical trading or quoting patterns in publicly available market data, and these observations sometimes result in a tip or complaint to a regulator. As the Commission discussed in the Notice, regulators investigate thousands of tips and complaints each year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAyaeU" NAME="fr_pAyaeU">1904</a> In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the Commission received around 15,000 entries in its Tips, Complaints and Referrals (&#8220;TCR&#8221;) system, approximately one third of which related to manipulation, insider trading, market events, or other trading and pricing issues. Analysis of tips and complaints generally follow three stages. First, regulators ensure that the tip or complaint contains sufficient information to facilitate analysis. Second, regulators use directly accessible data or make phone calls and other informal queries to determine if the tip or complaint is credible. Third, for tips and complaints that seem credible, regulators then perform a more in-depth investigation or examination, which follows the processes described above for examinations and enforcement investigations.</p>

The Commission did not receive any comments on its description of the current sources of trade and order data. The Commission received some comments on its description of the current limitations on trade and order data, which are discussed below. However, the Commission continues to believe that the current state of trade and order data, as described in detail in the Notice and as summarized below, reflects the relevant baseline for its economic analysis of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
          <p id="147f53cf-10b0-402f-910d-34d18585dcba">a. Current Sources of Trade and Order Data</p>
          <p id="f53996e2-07c9-4c55-ab6c-0635c9bcea9c">In the Notice, the Commission stated that SROs and the Commission currently use a range of trading and order data sources<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAHiRy" NAME="fr_pAHiRy">1905</a> for their regulatory activities. The types of data and ease of use of these sources of data can vary widely. The Notice reviewed the primary sources of data currently available to regulators, describing the content of the data provided and examples of their specialized uses.</p>
          <p id="f2442e99-4fe7-4a8b-9be0-d7b24629eac8">(1) SRO Data</p>
          <p id="d923a4f7-e872-4fc6-b5e3-b58a9fd3c1b6">As discussed in detail in the Notice, SROs maintain audit trails that contain trade and order data that they obtain from their members. Currently, regulators have access to at least three sources of audit trail data. First, the National Association of Securities Dealers (&#8220;NASD&#8221;) established its OATS in 1998, which required NASD (n/k/a FINRA) members to report certain trade and order data regarding NASDAQ-listed equity securities. OATS was later expanded to include OTC Equity Securities and all NMS stocks. Second, beginning in 2000, several of the current options exchanges implemented the Consolidated Options Audit Trail System (&#8220;COATS&#8221;). Finally, each equities and options exchange keeps an audit trail of orders and trades that occur on its market.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAmPBM" NAME="fr_pAmPBM">1906</a></p>
          <p id="0582859f-c4c7-4f90-a4a5-e7d41d2e6d7d">The Commission explained that for each of these stages in the life of an order, <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4434">FINRA Rule 7440</a> requires the recording and reporting of the following information, as applicable, including but not limited to: for the receipt or origination of the order, the date and time the order was first originated or received by the reporting member, a unique order identifier, the market participant symbol of the receiving reporting member, and the material terms of the order; for the internal or external routing of an order, the unique order identifier, the market participant symbol of the member to which the order was transmitted, the identification and nature of the department to which the order was transmitted if transmitted internally, the date and time the order was received by the market participant or department to which the order was transmitted, the material terms of the order as transmitted, the date and time the order was transmitted, and the market participant symbol of the member who transmitted the order; for the modification or cancellation of an order, a new unique order identifier, original unique order identifier, the date and time a modification or cancellation was originated or received, and the date and time the order was first received or originated; and for the execution of an order, in whole or in part, the unique order identifier, the designation of the order as fully or partially executed, the number of shares to which a partial execution applies and the number of unexecuted shares remaining, the date and time of execution, the execution price, the capacity in which the member executed the transaction, the identification of the market where the trade was reported, and the date and time the order was originally received. <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4434">FINRA Rule 7440</a> also requires reporting of the account type, the identification of the department or terminal where an order is received from a customer, the identification of the department or terminal where an order is originated by a reporting member, and the identification of a reporting agent if the agent has agreed to take on the responsibilities of a reporting member under <a href="http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=4435">Rule 7450</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz201-3" NAME="fr_pz201-3">1907</a></p>
          <p id="b35fde71-d1b6-4b6c-9237-5ce9e67c7881">The Commission also explained that a majority of options exchanges require their members to provide the following information with respect to orders entered onto their exchange: (1) the material terms of the order; (2) order receipt time; (3) account type; (4) the time a modification is received; (5) the time a cancellation is received; (6) execution time; and (7) the clearing member identifier of the parties to the transaction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz201-4" NAME="fr_pz201-4">1908</a></p>
          <p id="8b2f7ab5-d3f8-4655-9754-472b10555661">As discussed in the Notice, SRO audit trail data is used for market reconstructions and market analyses, and to inform policy decisions, both by the Commission and by SROs. Regulators also use SRO audit trail data extensively for surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions. Current SRO market surveillance relies primarily on data from the SRO audit trails, generated directly from the exchange servers and from OATS. Likewise, SRO examinations and investigations pull information from their own audit trails before seeking data from others. Commission examinations and investigations also rely heavily on SRO audit trails to start the process of tracing a particular trade from its execution to the order initiation and customer information, and the audit trails can be useful for manipulation investigations or other regulatory activities that require analyses of microcap securities trading activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz202-5" NAME="fr_pz202-5">1909</a></p>
          <p id="4dd6a037-10d0-4671-8192-205d77c9753e">(2) Equity and Option Cleared Reports</p>
          <p id="2805d2a9-c2ea-47fe-bf58-7befb982ee3b">The SROs and the Commission also have access to equity and option cleared reports. In the Notice, the Commission noted that clearing broker-dealers report their equity and option cleared data on a daily basis and the NSCC and the OCC aggregate the data across the market and generate the reports.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz202-6" NAME="fr_pz202-6">1910</a> Equity and option cleared reports provide a way for regulators to directly access a dataset to see how much trading volume is accounted for by a particular clearing broker. As such, these data are often used at the beginning of an examination or investigation to start identifying the market participants that may have additional data needed to pinpoint a particular activity.</p>
          <p id="e67b819c-1246-4595-8ce9-4553c9326832">(3) Electronic Blue Sheets</p>
          <p id="503f23a1-bb3a-45dd-ac79-0c2a2f7539ce">As the Commission discussed in the Notice, broker-dealers also provide detailed data to regulators in the form of Electronic Blue Sheets (&#8220;EBS&#8221;). The EBS data, provided pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117a_625">Rule 17a-25</a> under the Act, facilitate investigations by the SROs and Commission Staff, particularly in the areas of insider trading and market manipulations. The EBS system provides certain detailed execution information in its electronic format upon request by SRO or Commission Staff. This information often includes the employer of the beneficial owner of an account, which can be important to insider trading investigations, and in some cases, a tax identification number.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz203-7" NAME="fr_pz203-7">1911</a></p>
          <p id="de35874d-3bd2-4485-aab3-1fd8d7dc0e94">The EBS system also provides additional information on market participants who meet the definition of &#8220;large traders&#8221; and have self-identified to the Commission as required by <a href="https://gov.ecfr.io/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0890800730a4def1d309f8bd7f67ee05&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.240_113h_6l&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 13h-1</a>. Large trader data provide the Commission with a way to acquire information about the activities of large traders and allow the activities of large traders to be more readily aggregated across or partitioned by multiple broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz203-8" NAME="fr_pz203-8">1912</a></p>
          <p id="5ebf6354-6db7-412b-bf1f-ca38f7598489">(4) Trade Blotters and Order Tickets</p>
          <p id="bb7d3fa9-dae1-4623-922b-ee38090a049d">As the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, investment advisers and broker-dealers also maintain data in the form of order tickets and trade blotters that regulators can obtain on request. Order tickets are in-house records maintained by investment advisers and broker-dealers that provide order details, including timestamps of order initiation and placement, special order types, any special instructions for the order, and plans for the allocation of shares and prices across accounts and subaccounts. Order tickets also identify account owners. Commission Staff collects order tickets regularly for examinations, and occasionally also for market manipulation investigations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-4" NAME="fr_pz204-4">1913</a></p>
          <p id="9b15601d-fae9-4c30-8bda-4c4f3b394771">The Commission discussed the fact that broker-dealers maintain data in trade blotters that are similar to EBS. However, the trade blotters also contain more information, including the commissions paid in executing each order, timestamps of when an order is received and when it is executed (and the number of fills), and the pricing information for all executions in the order. SROs use trade blotters in examinations of their members. Commission Staff uses trade blotters frequently for examinations, including in almost every broker-dealer, investment adviser, and hedge fund examination, as well as for insider trading and market manipulation investigations. Regulators use trade blotter data to determine the order entry time and execution time for trades by a particular customer in examinations and enforcement investigations. Trade blotters are also the primary data source used in regulatory investigations for which subaccount allocation information is important for determining violative behavior, such as cherry-picking and front-running cases.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-5" NAME="fr_pz204-5">1914</a></p>
          <p id="f1064cf5-0138-42eb-ac67-65d84c3d9f8c">As the Commission discussed in the Notice, broker-dealers and exchanges collect and maintain records of activity in their order handling systems and internal matching systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-6" NAME="fr_pz204-6">1915</a> Some of the data that is collected and maintained in these systems exceeds the scope of information captured in EBS, SRO audit trail, trade blotter, or order ticket data and may include data on order receipt, modification or routing information not otherwise reported to SROs. Regulators use these trading and order handling system data in investigations and examinations to further analyze issues discovered during their analysis of data from other sources.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pApbVrj" NAME="fr_pApbVrj">1916</a></p>
          <p id="cac81186-aba8-4035-b0e6-e57244ebc71d">(5) Public Data</p>
          <p id="79fa805b-41bf-4d98-a717-ab88cc8e3f89">As discussed in detail in the Notice, exchanges and SROs make some data available to the public and regulators can access these data for their regulatory activities. One type of public data is &#8220;consolidated&#8221; data feeds that are disseminated by registered Securities Information Processors (&#8220;SIPs&#8221;) pursuant to joint SRO plans. For a fee, the SIPs distribute consolidated market data on recent equity and option transactions and the prevailing best quotes at each exchange to market data subscribers. Additionally, all exchanges also make data available through direct data feeds. These feeds contain all data included in the SIP feed, but also include depth of book information and, depending on the exchange, may include additional data, such as the submission, cancellation and execution of all displayed orders and auction imbalance information on the exchange, among other things. Furthermore, at the request of Commission Staff, most equities exchanges also produce and make public two datasets with information on short sales: a file of short selling volume by stock, which contains the short selling and total volume on that exchange by symbol, and a file of short selling transactions, which contains trade information such as time, volume, and price for each transaction involving a short sale.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz206-5" NAME="fr_pz206-5">1917</a></p>
          <p id="82d7e960-4daf-4f21-a14f-0be448969b56">The Commission and SROs use these publicly available trade and order data to conduct market analyses, market reconstructions, examinations, and investigations. Due to the accessibility and ease of use of the public data, regulators often use it as a starting point or a basis of comparison to other data sources. For example, real-time surveillance can rely on SIP data, and some insider trading surveillance relies on information from other publicly available sources such as news sources. Further, investigations into short sale market manipulation sometimes start with an analysis of the short selling data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz206-6" NAME="fr_pz206-6">1918</a></p>

          <p id="ee19443a-afea-484c-b835-e53e2768260f">As the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, while regulators have access to trade and order data from the sources described above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz206-7" NAME="fr_pz206-7">1919</a> the available data are, for various reasons, limited in terms of the four qualities discussed above.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA1Gh" NAME="fr_pA1Gh">1920</a> In terms of completeness, current sources do not represent all of the market activity of interest in sufficient detail in one consolidated audit trail. In terms of accuracy, current sources may reflect data errors, insufficiently granular clock synchronization and timestamps, errors introduced in the process of combining data from different sources, a lack of consistent customer and broker-dealer identifiers, and data that is too aggregated at the record level to provide the information regulators need. In terms of accessibility, the SROs and Commission lack direct access to most of the data sources described above, and with respect to timeliness, obtaining trade and order data from current sources and converting the data into a form in which they can be analyzed can involve a significant delay from the time of a particular event of interest. Due to these limitations on current data sources, as the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, regulators are limited in their ability to perform the activities outlined in Section V.D.1, above. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the currently available data sources, the limitations of which are discussed in more detail below.</p>

The Commission explained in the Notice that, to obtain information regarding a particular market event, regulators may have to piece together information from different data sources and that some data is not required to be reported at all under existing regulations. Therefore, as described below, current data sources either cover only a limited number of events and products, or lack some data fields that would be useful to regulators, each of which impedes effective market surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-8" NAME="fr_pz209-8">1926</a></p>
          <p id="14df84e2-241a-40a0-adc8-0323d66b9236">One commenter agreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis by stating that &#8220;[t]he fragmented nature of current data sources does pose significant challenges to regulators seeking complete data.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-9" NAME="fr_pz209-9">1927</a></p>
          <p id="68e10aed-e565-44e8-b621-f866625c08de">A. Events and Products</p>
          <p id="3487468e-f62a-4510-b11a-c68fe8357304">As the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, there is currently no single data source that covers all market activities. EBS data contains executed trades but does not contain information on orders or quotes (and thus does not provide information on routes, modifications, or cancellations). Similarly, trade blotters and order tickets contain only information recorded by the particular broker-dealer or investment adviser that generated them and may contain limited information about full order lifecycles. SRO audit trail data are limited to identifying the activity of their members, can have incomplete information concerning their members, lack order lifecycle information occurring prior to receipt by an exchange, and may not contain information regarding principal trading. Furthermore, although public consolidated and direct data feeds provide data about the entire market, they lack information regarding non-displayed orders and do not provide sufficient information to identify the different lifecycle events of a single order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-3" NAME="fr_pz210-3">1928</a></p>
          <p id="0714a0ce-6c9c-4d1b-887a-a8be1fdba2ea">The Commission also discussed individual SRO audit trails. While extensive, they contain only activity of their own members, and many SRO audit trails are incomplete in their coverage of the activities of those members. For example, FINRA&#8217;s OATS data does not include proprietary orders originated by a trading desk in the ordinary course of a member&#8217;s market making activities, or options data. And while OATS collects data from FINRA members with respect to orders and trades involving NMS and OTC stocks, OATS does not include trade or order activity that occurs on exchanges or at broker-dealers that are not FINRA members. In addition, while broker-dealers who are not members of FINRA must be members of an exchange SRO, an individual exchange SRO&#8217;s audit trail data is generally limited to activity taking place on that exchange. The Commission noted that because broker-dealers who are not members of FINRA may engage in trading activity in off-exchange markets, a substantial portion of the trading activity that an exchange SRO supervises is not reported to the supervising SRO.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-4" NAME="fr_pz210-4">1929</a> The Commission also discussed the fact that not all FINRA members are obligated to report to OATS. FINRA&#8217;s rules exclude from reporting certain members that engage in a non-discretionary order routing process. Additionally, FINRA has the authority to exempt the manual orders of other members who meet specific criteria from the OATS recording and reporting requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-7" NAME="fr_pz211-7">1930</a></p>
          <p id="40896ef3-5250-4a9f-805a-59200f434d54">The Commission also explained that some SRO audit trails do not include and are not required to include activity associated with principal trading, such as market-making activity. This may result in the exclusion of a significant amount of activity, particularly for firms with substantial market-making business activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-8" NAME="fr_pz211-8">1931</a></p>
          <p id="3a8963f8-402a-4502-8983-3f937c2fa1ed">Finally, the Commission discussed the fact that no single current data source integrates both equities and options, and that the lack of any combined equity and options audit trail data is a significant impediment to regulators performing cross-product surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-9" NAME="fr_pz211-9">1932</a></p>
          <p id="47b79c51-cddd-4eb1-9856-b8c080946688">B. Data Fields</p>
          <p id="d4f0b093-f80c-421b-b21e-1d721074cf25">As addressed in detail in the Notice, each of the currently available data sources discussed above is missing certain data fields that are useful for conducting a variety of regulatory activities. Furthermore, certain valuable data fields are not contained in any of the data sources discussed above.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-10" NAME="fr_pz211-10">1933</a></p>
          <p id="f0230ba7-380b-4646-b30a-95a95b81bfd8">Most notably, as the Commission explained in detail in the Notice, the identity of the customer is not available from any of the current data sources that are reported to regulators on a routine basis. As discussed in the Notice, a unique customer identifier could be useful for many types of investigations and examinations such as market manipulation investigations and examinations of investment advisers. The Commission also explained that although some data sources&#8212;specifically large trader reports, EBS, trade blotters, and order tickets&#8212;identify customers, these data sources are not reported on a routine basis, provide only one part of the order lifecycle, and have other inherent limitations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz212-4" NAME="fr_pz212-4">1934</a></p>
          <p id="355a230d-6f85-4b22-a341-2f7cc9faabe9">The Commission explained that because there is currently no data source that includes customer identities across multiple parts of an order lifecycle, regulators must seek and link multiple sources of data, which can be a burdensome and imperfect process. For example, trade blotter and order ticket data that identify customers from one broker-dealer may only include customer names and thus may not be readily matched to similar data from another broker-dealer, or may require substantial time, effort, and uncertainty to reconcile across firms. Further, EBS data&#8217;s limited coverage of trading activity and lack of some detailed trade information raises costs and reduces the timeliness of insider trading investigations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz212-5" NAME="fr_pz212-5">1935</a></p>
          <p id="fa051842-fd51-413a-aea1-1d7df9e1f9f3">As the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, some valuable data fields, such as modifications that make an order non-displayed and other special handling instructions are consistently available on only a few data sources or require linking different data sources.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz212-6" NAME="fr_pz212-6">1936</a> The Commission explained that the lack of direct, consistent access to order display information and special handling instructions creates inefficiencies in surveillances, examinations, and investigations that examine hidden liquidity and the treatment of customer orders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz213-5" NAME="fr_pz213-5">1937</a></p>
          <p id="fb4510e6-d477-41c8-9eb4-573bba4c7c01">The Commission noted that data that are not directly accessible by regulators at all include buy-to-cover information and subaccount allocation information, including the allocation time. The Commission explained that regulators could use buy-to-cover information to better understand short selling and for investigations of short sale manipulation. However, no current data source allows regulators to directly identify when someone is buying to cover a short sale.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz213-6" NAME="fr_pz213-6">1938</a></p>
          <p id="e9a9a7f5-fc3b-47c6-8972-cf003f456650">As the Commission discussed in the Notice, subaccount allocation information needed for regulatory activities can be difficult for regulators to collect and compile because SRO audit trails currently do not require allocation reports and broker-dealers may not have records of the time of a subaccount allocation. The Commission explained that when regulators require an understanding of subaccount allocations for a regulatory task, they generally request and sift through trade blotter or EBS data in an attempt to identify allocations and the details of those allocations. However, current trade blotter data contains limited customer information on allocations and is not required to contain allocation time information at the subaccount level.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz213-7" NAME="fr_pz213-7">1939</a></p>
          <p id="5d075a6c-269a-4984-b897-bc321cf6c036">The Commission explained that the difficulty in obtaining allocation information and the difficulty in reconstructing allocations with data from broker-dealers limits the efficiency of certain surveillances and examinations. In particular, allocation time at the subaccount level is critical for determining whether some customers are systematically given more favorable allocation treatment than others. For example, when a broker-dealer places an order or series of orders for multiple customer accounts that generates multiple executions at multiple prices, it is possible that different customers receive different prices in the allocation process. However, if some customers systematically receive less favorable prices than others when they should be receiving the same prices for their executions, this could indicate that the broker-dealer is handling allocations improperly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz214-4" NAME="fr_pz214-4">1940</a></p>
          <p id="db0b5c6b-525f-4162-9349-02b68916dfaf">Three commenters noted that the open/close indicator is currently not captured for equities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz214-5" NAME="fr_pz214-5">1941</a> In their response, the Participants agreed with this assessment.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz214-6" NAME="fr_pz214-6">1942</a> In addition, the Participants indicated that, pursuant to current industry practice, the open/close indicator is also not captured for some options transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz214-7" NAME="fr_pz214-7">1943</a></p>
          <p id="31f0a1dc-90d1-4cde-bc01-26516dba605a">The Commission has considered the comments it received regarding the current limitations of trade and order data in terms of completeness. The open/close indicator would provide information about whether a transaction is undertaken to open or increase a position in the security, or to close or reduce a position in the security, such as a buy-to-cover a short sale, which the Commission in the Notice stated was information not directly accessible to regulators today. Therefore, the commenters expressing that the open/close indicator is not currently captured for equities are consistent with the baseline discussed in the Notice; the open/close indicator is one type of a broader category of information that the Commission recognized is lacking from current audit trails.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz227-10" NAME="fr_pz227-10">1944</a> In addition, although the Commission did not discuss this issue in the Notice, the Commission now recognizes that the open/close indicator is currently not captured for certain options transactions.</p>
          <p id="0afb749b-1f7d-4244-8f76-8bcb5e61dc62">(2) Accuracy</p>
          <p id="8e2952e8-42fd-4015-a9ed-01c8b981d8e6">In the Notice, the Commission carefully considered the accuracy of data currently used by regulators in order to consider whether and to what degree the CAT NMS Plan would provide more accurate data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz215-7" NAME="fr_pz215-7">1945</a> As discussed in more detail below, the Commission considered several forms of data inaccuracy, including data errors, inaccurate event sequencing, the inability to link data accurately, inconsistent identifiers, and obfuscating levels of irreversible data aggregation.</p>
          <p id="bf2df74a-5786-48e1-ad7d-b6b74dd6ec55">A. Data Errors</p>
          <p id="0ca40524-ce65-4e5a-a918-990a78b61a19">With respect to data errors,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz215-8" NAME="fr_pz215-8">1946</a> the Commission stated its preliminary belief that data errors affect most current data used by regulators and can persist even after corrections. The Commission specifically noted instances where information was inaccurately reported by broker-dealers and discussed various errors in data translated from back-office systems, errors in data from trading systems, and errors in audit trail data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-3" NAME="fr_pz216-3">1947</a> Furthermore, the Commission noted that the CAT NMS Plan reports that 2.42% of order events submitted to OATS fail validation checks. Although FINRA sends these records back to its members to correct, significant error rates in event linking post-correction are common because OATS limits error correction requests to records with internal inconsistencies within a given member&#8217;s submission and there is no cross-participant error resolution process. FINRA estimates that 0.5% of OATS routing reports directed to another FINRA member broker-dealer cannot currently be linked.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-4" NAME="fr_pz216-4">1948</a> Also, as stated in the Notice, the CAT NMS Plan reports that, following the rollouts of three major updates to OATS, 0.86% of Trade Reporting Facility reported trades could not be matched to OATS execution reports, 3.12% of OATS route reports could not be matched to exchange orders, and 2.44% of inter-firm routes could not be matched to a record of the receiving firm&#8217;s receipt of a routed order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-5" NAME="fr_pz216-5">1949</a></p>
          <p id="82e07d58-4129-4c0d-9849-a511513416be">The Commission received several comment letters that discussed the current state of errors in data used by regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-6" NAME="fr_pz216-6">1950</a> One commenter did not believe that OATS data currently achieves &#8220;de minimis&#8221; errors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-7" NAME="fr_pz216-7">1951</a> The commenter further stated that there are instances where errors cannot be corrected in OATS and gave true duplicates and non-reportable symbols as examples.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-8" NAME="fr_pz216-8">1952</a> The commenter further detailed the classification scheme currently used to categorize OATS errors. According to the commenter, these errors are currently classified as: rejects; unmatched executions; unmatched exchange routes; inter firm received unmatched; inter firm sent unmatched; out of sequence; and late reports.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz217-4" NAME="fr_pz217-4">1953</a></p>
          <p id="7e1ca76e-fc32-4e58-8a7d-7538a2f3b409">Another commenter stated in two separate letters that there are OATS reporters that are repeatedly non-compliant, both in omitting to report required data and reporting inaccurate data to FINRA.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz217-5" NAME="fr_pz217-5">1954</a> The commenter contended that the extent of this non-compliance is significant and is magnified by the lengthy period of time before the errors are discovered and corrected by FINRA. Also, there is no way to know the magnitude of noncompliance that is never detected and therefore never corrected. The non-compliance by reporters may cause the error rates reported by OATS to be higher than reported.</p>
          <p id="19315f45-88fb-4ee9-b4e6-dc47714fc0c8">The Commission has considered the comments received. The Commission agrees with the commenter that stated there are instances where OATS data does not fail validation checks, but does contain errors. As mentioned in the Notice, OATS validation checks are limited to detecting errors that can be discovered by a concise set of logical rules and OATS limits error correction requests to records with internal inconsistencies within a given member&#8217;s submission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz217-6" NAME="fr_pz217-6">1955</a> The Commission also recognizes the comment that some OATS reporters fail to send and/or send inaccurate reports to FINRA and is updating its analysis to take into account that current data errors in OATS may be larger than initially considered due to this noncompliance. Finally, the Commission now considers the error classifications provided by a commenter in its baseline.</p>
          <p id="7aa26bcc-92b1-4f7e-9204-13af3818202d">B. Event Sequencing</p>
          <p id="3e2baf16-600b-4ea4-bfc0-6dcfc16fc8a3">With respect to event sequencing, as the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, the ability to sequence market events is crucial to the efficacy of detecting and investigating some types of manipulation, and the sequencing of order events requires both sufficient clock synchronization across market participants and timestamps that are granular enough for accurate sequencing, but the current clock synchronization standards make this process difficult.</p>
          <p id="7b7d8522-1fc9-4325-8870-07ac9a22cbac">In the Notice, the Commission discussed that current rules require most broker-dealers to synchronize their system clocks to within one second.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-4" NAME="fr_pz218-4">1956</a> The Commission further noted that &#8220;in practice&#8221; some broker-dealers currently synchronize their clocks to smaller clock offset tolerances. The Commission cited the FIF Clock Offset Survey<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-5" NAME="fr_pz218-5">1957</a> where 29% of respondents report they currently synchronize their clock to permit a maximum clock offset of one second from NIST, 10% of respondents permit a maximum offset of 50 milliseconds to one second, 21% of respondents permit a 50 millisecond maximum offset, and 18% of respondents permit a maximum offset less than 50 milliseconds. The remaining 22% of respondents report they utilize multiple clock offset tolerances across their systems ranging from five microseconds to one second. In addition, the Commission discussed that FINRA had filed a proposed rule change that would reduce the clock offset tolerance for members&#8217; computer clocks that are used to record events in NMS securities from within one second of the NIST atomic clock to within 50 milliseconds of the NIST atomic clock.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-6" NAME="fr_pz218-6">1958</a> Furthermore, the Commission discussed that if the rule change was approved, more entities would record timestamps with data at a 50 millisecond clock offset tolerance regardless of whether the CAT NMS Plan is approved.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz219-4" NAME="fr_pz219-4">1959</a></p>
          <p id="681d4328-45f8-481b-9948-d21f7548d1f1">For clock synchronization on exchanges, the Commission discussed in the Notice that exchanges trading NASDAQ securities currently adhere to clock synchronization standards at or below 100 microseconds, and the Commission understands that the NYSE, the options exchanges, and the SIAC SIP have comparable clock synchronization standards. In addition, the Commission noted that Participants stated &#8220;that absolute clock offset on exchanges averages 36 microseconds.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz219-5" NAME="fr_pz219-5">1960</a></p>
          <p id="2697a393-ecd9-42ec-b77b-676619025851">Also in the Notice, Commission Staff conducted an analysis of the frequency of order events using MIDAS data which identified whether for each order event, an event in the same security at another venue occurred within a given time range. 97.95% of order events for listed equities and 91% of order events for listed options occurred within one second of another unrelated order event in the same security. 14.44% of the unrelated order events for listed equities and 3.12% of the unrelated order events for listed options in the same security occurred within 5 microseconds of another order event in the same security. The Commission noted that the analysis underestimates the true frequency of unrelated events within the given time frames because it includes only order events that are included in the MIDAS data, and furthermore stated that the analysis illustrates how the current frequency of order events makes sequencing unrelated order events difficult. With respect to the granularity of timestamps, the Commission discussed in the Notice that regulators need sufficiently granular timestamps to sequence events across orders and within order lifecycles, and that the current lack of uniform and granular timestamps can limit the ability of regulators to sequence events accurately and link data with information from other data sources.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz220-3" NAME="fr_pz220-3">1961</a> In addition, the Commission discussed that current data sources have different timestamp granularity standards, and that many public data sources report time in seconds or milliseconds, and some, including direct data feeds, report time in microseconds or nanoseconds. As examples, the Commission stated that OPRA allows for timestamps in nanoseconds and that the other SIPs require timestamps in microseconds for equity trades and quotes, whereas the short sale transactional data released by exchanges contains timestamps in seconds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz220-4" NAME="fr_pz220-4">1962</a> In addition, the Commission stated that OATS requires timestamps in milliseconds for firms that capture time in milliseconds, but does not require members to capture time in milliseconds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz220-5" NAME="fr_pz220-5">1963</a></p>

          <p id="6488d098-4490-4c62-89de-182c3e832cb5">The Participants&#8217; response provided new information on the current clock synchronization standards of Participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-5" NAME="fr_pz222-5">1973</a> Specifically, the response clarified that all Participants currently operate pursuant to a clock synchronization standard of 100 microseconds with regard to their electronic systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-6" NAME="fr_pz222-6">1974</a></p>
          <p id="e8ff01fd-3a64-4ec7-8e7a-3678e80cbdb5">The Commission has considered these comments and, as discussed below, has updated its analysis of the baseline of clock synchronization as set out in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="42e8a944-5867-4cb2-9949-730daa4c8cb9">In the Notice, the Commission explained that its analysis of the frequency of order events used MIDAS data, recognized the limitations that its use of MIDAS data could impose, and explained how the limitations reflected the Commission&#8217;s assessment of the baseline.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-7" NAME="fr_pz222-7">1975</a> The Commission therefore agrees with the commenter that its analysis reflects a disproportionate number of exchange events relative to off-exchange events. But because the commenter did not explain how the limitations of the Commission&#8217;s analysis could make the analysis less useful or what statistical biases could result from these limitations, the Commission believes that, despite its limitations, the analysis &#8220;still provides useful insights&#8221; and &#8220;illustrates how the current frequency of order events makes sequencing unrelated order events difficult.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-8" NAME="fr_pz222-8">1976</a></p>
          <p id="7a855dcc-b76e-4076-8216-2eafbe3ec346">The Commission generally agrees that events can be sequenced due to daisy chaining, but notes that for most regulatory activities,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-9" NAME="fr_pz222-9">1977</a> it is crucial for the regulators to be able to accurately sequence events from different orders. Furthermore, the Commission believes that such sequencing requires both sufficient clock synchronization across market participants and sufficiently granular timestamps.</p>
          <p id="2e5f9eea-874a-46c3-bf21-ad85d4413af4">With respect to comments regarding manual orders, the Commission believes the new insights provided by commenters are consistent with the baseline in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="3941ca3a-c148-4d53-9a75-2fd680ac2e54">The Commission is updating its economic baseline to include the new information provided by the Participants and also to include the approval of a FINRA rule amendment. Specifically, the Commission now believes that all Participants currently operate pursuant to a clock synchronization standard of 100 microseconds. Also, the Commission approved the proposed rule change by FINRA that was discussed in the Notice that reduces the synchronization tolerance for computer clocks to 50 milliseconds for member firms that record events in NMS Securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz223-5" NAME="fr_pz223-5">1978</a> Accordingly, FINRA members that record events in NMS Securities currently operate, or in the near future will operate, pursuant to a clock synchronization standard of 50 milliseconds for their computer clocks.</p>

          <p id="ff3a0ee0-4ca6-45c7-8d74-2b583a786167">Regarding data linking, as the Commission addressed in detail in the Notice, regulators analyzing an event or running a surveillance pattern often need to link data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz223-6" NAME="fr_pz223-6">1979</a> As examples, the Commission stated that cross-market examinations require the cumbersome and time-consuming task of linking many different data sources; that regulators that are determining whether rule violations have occurred will combine trading data from sources such as public feeds, SRO audit trails, EBS data, and trade blotters; and that the analysis and reconstruction of market events could require linking many different data sources, such as a dozen SRO audit trails.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz223-7" NAME="fr_pz223-7">1980</a></p>
          <p id="670434f9-f228-43a6-8370-4cfc855401c8">The Commission discussed that merging different data sources often involves translating the data sources into the same format, which can be a complex process that is prone to error.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz224-4" NAME="fr_pz224-4">1981</a> In addition, the Commission discussed that linking records within or across data sources requires the sources to share &#8220;key fields&#8221; that facilitate linkage, but that regulators may be unable to link some data source combinations accurately because the data sources do not have key fields in common or the key fields are not sufficiently granular; also, different data sources may have key fields in common but the relationship between the fields is not straightforward so the algorithm to link them may be necessarily complex and not entirely successful.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz224-5" NAME="fr_pz224-5">1982</a> Furthermore, the Commission discussed that within a single order lifecycle, the order number may change when a broker-dealer routes the order to another broker-dealer or exchange or even to another desk at the same broker-dealer. Finally, the Commission discussed that the inability to link all records affects the accuracy of the resulting data and can force an inefficient manual linkage process that would delay the completion of the data collection and analysis portion of an examination, investigation, or reconstruction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz224-6" NAME="fr_pz224-6">1983</a></p>

          <p id="b4355444-8d58-4b6e-8923-4e09ab3c2377">With respect to market participant identifiers (&#8220;MPIDs&#8221;), the Commission explained that trade and order data currently available to the Commission lack consistent customer and broker-dealer identifiers, which limit regulators&#8217; ability to track the activity of one client or broker-dealer across the market.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz224-7" NAME="fr_pz224-7">1984</a> In the case of broker-dealers, the Commission stated that identifiers are inconsistent and that no centralized database exists. In addition, although SROs generally identify their members using MPIDs, those MPIDS are not standardized across venues.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz225-4" NAME="fr_pz225-4">1985</a> The Commission further stated that aggregating a broker-dealer&#8217;s activity across venues requires verifying the MPIDs assigned to a broker-dealer on each venue, usually referencing the broker-dealer by its Central Registration Depository (&#8220;CRD&#8221;) number. Finally, the Commission stated that in the course of manual data analysis, Commission Staff have experienced challenges in identifying broker-dealers using CRD numbers, but that the Commission and the SROs have generally overcome these challenges in the context of automated regulatory data analysis.</p>
          <p id="d30b2885-70a4-456a-a99c-37494c1b9651">In the case of broker-dealer customers, the Commission stated that identifying customer account owners across multiple broker-dealers is difficult and prone to error.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz225-5" NAME="fr_pz225-5">1986</a> As an example, the Commission discussed that although the EBS system provides the names associated with each account traded, these names are drawn from separate records of each broker-dealer providing data to the EBS system, and the same party may be identified by a different name across multiple broker-dealers.</p>
          <p id="7419cf37-3328-450c-bf25-6eb47bcf71ce">One commenter discussed the difficulty in tracking market participant activity using MPIDs, stating that &#8220;[w]ith regard to trade identifiers used by market access providers, some clearing firms have used one or more MPIDs to conceal the identity of other participants/clients using these services to manipulate markets.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz225-6" NAME="fr_pz225-6">1987</a> The Commission agrees that tracking market participant activity using MPIDs can be difficult because of sponsored or direct market access arrangements whereby broker-dealers allow customers to trade electronically using the broker-dealer&#8217;s MPID. In cases where the sponsored or direct market access customer is not a FINRA member, the EBS system allows regulators to observe the identity of trading parties that may be concealed by MPIDs, but, as discussed in the Notice, it is difficult to consistently identify trading parties across multiple broker-dealers because they may use different names across these broker-dealers. In addition, as discussed in the Notice, EBS data is cumbersome to use for broad analysis because of fragmentation of the data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz226-4" NAME="fr_pz226-4">1988</a> However, in cases where the sponsored or direct market access customer is a FINRA member, OATS reporting obligations require both the customer broker-dealer and the sponsoring broker-dealer to generate reports that, when linked correctly, allow regulators to observe the identity of the trading party.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz226-5" NAME="fr_pz226-5">1989</a></p>
          <p id="3b577e83-b885-4fc9-ba14-543798a5cfaf">E. Aggregation</p>
          <p id="580bbda9-510b-4bdc-b153-8d712e57ca5e">Regarding data aggregation, as addressed in detail in the Notice, the practice used in some data records of bundling together data from different orders and trades can make it difficult to distinguish the different orders and trades in a given bundle. That aggregation reduces the usefulness of equity and options cleared reports, because the reports do not have detailed trade information and do not include activity that does not require clearing.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz226-6" NAME="fr_pz226-6">1990</a> In the Notice, the Commission presented as an example the frequent use of average-price accounts by brokers to execute and aggregate multiple trades for one or more customers. The Commission discussed that for these cases, and with EBS data, the system does not reflect the details of each individual trade execution.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz227-7" NAME="fr_pz227-7">1991</a> Furthermore, the Commission discussed that information on trade allocations aggregate the trade information to such an extent that it is difficult for regulators to identify when particular clients may be afforded preferential treatment because it is challenging to link subaccount allocations to orders and trades.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz227-8" NAME="fr_pz227-8">1992</a></p>
          <p id="4504cb5a-d1bf-4499-89c3-d91ab97e6ee5">In addition, as the Commission discussed in the Notice, issuer repurchase information is aggregated at the monthly and quarterly level, and this level of aggregation limits the use of such data in investigations of the timing of issuer repurchases and issuer stock price manipulation and in analysis of the use of the <a href="https://gov.ecfr.io/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0890800730a4def1d309f8bd7f67ee05&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.240_110b_618&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 10b-18</a> issuer repurchase safe harbor.</p>
          <p id="226847ef-1125-45a7-9de9-4f4fa13ba933">(3) Accessibility</p>
          <p id="5b6cc2bc-0bd7-456f-9cf8-b0ee6560d760">As addressed in detail in the Notice, the SROs and the Commission also lack direct access&#8212;i.e., the ability to log into a system in a manner that would allow them to gather and analyze the data they need&#8212;to many of the data sources described above. SROs generally have direct access only to their own audit trails and the public data feeds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz227-9" NAME="fr_pz227-9">1993</a> The Commission has direct access only to the public data feeds and the equity and option cleared data; it lacks direct access to information provided in EBS or contained in trade blotters, order tickets, order handling data, SRO audit trails, and OATS data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz227-10" NAME="fr_pz227-10">1994</a></p>
          <p id="2fbbe38e-ea5b-4c83-9ccf-970b9a19afa5">The Commission explained that if a regulator does not have direct access to data it needs, the regulator would request it, and that this can result in many burdensome requests to broker-dealers, SROs, and others. The Commission recognized that data requests could impose burdens on the entities responding to the requests, in addition to the burden on the regulators making the requests. In particular, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and SROs responding to a data request must incur costs in order to produce, store, and transmit the data for the Commission or SRO.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-5" NAME="fr_pz228-5">1995</a></p>
          <p id="ba0db05a-9025-43e2-ac80-f7ba918a9834">The Commission explained that, to complete just one analysis, regulators may need to request data from many different data providers because of fragmentation in the data. The Commission discussed the fact that fragmentation in trade and order data can take many forms. First, an analysis may require the same type of data from many market participants. For example, while ATSs and dealers report order events in equities to OATS, each of the 12 equities exchanges has its own audit trail. As a result, a market reconstruction for a single security may involve data requests to multiple exchanges as well as to FINRA.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-6" NAME="fr_pz228-6">1996</a></p>
          <p id="baaa7f47-1db3-41f2-8c60-6e53c26d6ed5">Second, the required data fields for an analysis may be reflected in different types of data. For example, for investigations that require tracing a single trade or a set of trades back to an investor or investors, regulators would first need to request data from the exchanges or market participants executing trades to find out which members, subscribers, or broker-dealers sent the orders that led to the executions. Then, regulators would need to ask the members, subscribers, and broker-dealers for information on the orders and repeat that process until they get to the broker-dealer who initiated the order to see the customer behind the order.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-7" NAME="fr_pz228-7">1997</a></p>
          <p id="32c9a1f7-7012-4c02-9e8e-1afc6247193d">Third, an analysis may require data on different products covered in separate data sources. For example, some regulatory activities require data on both equities and options. And because current data sources do not contain information regarding both equities and options, regulators needing data on both types of securities would need to make several data requests.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz229-7" NAME="fr_pz229-7">1998</a></p>
          <p id="737c5f43-f62f-47b0-bc2c-3f7d24abeccf">As the Commission discussed in the Notice, data fragmentation also results in disparate requirements for industry members to record and report the same information in multiple formats. Because each SRO has its own data requirements, a market participant that is a member of multiple SROs may be required to report audit trail data in numerous formats and interact with multiple regulators in response to normal data queries.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz229-8" NAME="fr_pz229-8">1999</a></p>
          <p id="baba0612-aa87-4fcb-baef-cf7e5c0bcc6c">(4) Timeliness</p>
          <p id="13512240-12a4-4ff8-b4c0-c17f24bbcad0">As addressed in detail in the Notice, currently, obtaining trade and order data and converting the data into a form in which they can be analyzed can involve a significant delay from the time of a particular event of interest. In some cases the length of time from when an event occurs until regulators can use relevant data in an investigation or analysis can be weeks or months. This is especially true for trading data that includes customer information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz229-9" NAME="fr_pz229-9">2000</a></p>
          <p id="4dee7112-65f6-455c-b051-38ea4f085c89">The Commission explained in the Notice that corrected FINRA OATS data may be available less than two weeks after an event and uncorrected data on T+1. In particular, FINRA members submit OATS data on a daily basis, submitting end-of-day files by 8:00 a.m. ET the following day or they are marked late by FINRA. FINRA acknowledges receipt of the data an hour after the member submits it, before running its validation process. FINRA then takes approximately four hours after acknowledging receipt of OATS data to determine if the data contain any syntax errors. In addition to the four hours needed to identify errors within a report, it takes another 24 hours for context checking, which identifies duplicates or secondary events without an originating event. Once a context rejection is available, the member has up to five business days to repair the rejection. Reports for files that contain internally inconsistent information about processing, linking, and routing orders may be available within two business days. FINRA attempts to match the inconsistent information against any additional data received up to T+2 for linking errors and T+3 for routing errors. The timing for surveillance programs varies depending on the type of surveillance being performed; data is assumed to be completely processed and corrected at T+8.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz230-3" NAME="fr_pz230-3">2001</a></p>
          <p id="4c39dfd1-5dd5-4c6e-afd1-d9588e8b5de3">The Commission also explained that because market participants generally do not report or compile datasets immediately after an order event, there is a delay before regulators may access some data sources. For example, the compilation of equity and option cleared reports occurs on T+1 for options and T+3 for equities (i.e., the clearing day) and the electronic query access for equities is available from the Securities Information Automation Corporation (&#8220;SIAC&#8221;) on T+3. Additionally, when broker-dealers receive a request for EBS, the firm must first fill in the EBS report and then, if it does not self-clear, pass the reports on to its clearing firm to compile and send to SIAC. The EBS submission process can take up to ten business days. More immediate requests for cleared options data can be submitted to FINRA, but even this process takes up to two days. Because EBS data do not contain order entry time and order execution time, regulators must obtain this information from firms and brokers using either data requests or subpoenas, and this process generally can take from two to four weeks depending on the size of the request.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz231-3" NAME="fr_pz231-3">2002</a></p>
          <p id="720cfa73-091e-404c-b269-13d02a3aded0">In addition, the Commission noted that the lack of direct access to most data sources may further delay the ability of regulators to use data in certain cases. When regulators have direct access to a data source, the time needed to receive data is only the time it takes for a query to run. On the other hand, when regulators lack direct access, their data requests can consume significant time, including both the time required to put the request together and response times from the SROs, broker-dealers, and others producing the data. For example, obtaining complete responses from each broker-dealer for an EBS request can take days or weeks depending on the scope of the request. Likewise, responses from the Intermarket Surveillance Group (&#8220;ISG&#8221;) for SRO audit trail data can take days or weeks.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz231-4" NAME="fr_pz231-4">2003</a> As the Commission discussed in the Notice, once regulators receive the requested data, the data often have to be processed into a form in which they can be analyzed. The Commission explained that it can take considerable time for regulators to combine data from different sources and link records from within or across data sources. Furthermore, the lack of consistency in format adds complexity to projects involving data from multiple data sources, even when the project does not involve linking of these different data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz231-5" NAME="fr_pz231-5">2004</a></p>
          <p id="369499c2-551c-4453-ac11-033aedfd06ef">The Commission further discussed that those who use regulatory data also typically take time to ensure the accuracy of the data. The Commission explained that when regulators question the accuracy of data, they often check several alternative sources until they are comfortable that their data are accurate. This checking of data accuracy and augmentation process adds time to an investigation or analysis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz232-6" NAME="fr_pz232-6">2005</a></p>

        <p id="d8b9af3a-3144-496d-8c76-6c374935a591">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief that the economic benefits of the CAT NMS Plan would come from any expanded or more efficient regulatory activities facilitated by improvements to the data regulators use.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz232-7" NAME="fr_pz232-7">2006</a> This is because the Plan will create a new consolidated data source&#8212;CAT Data&#8212;that should replace the use of some current data sources for many regulatory activities. Therefore, the Benefits Section described how CAT Data compares to data regulators currently use for regulatory activities, how the CAT Data would improve regulatory activities, and how these improvements would benefit investors, market participants, and markets in general.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz232-8" NAME="fr_pz232-8">2007</a></p>
        <p id="2ff8a70f-f7a5-45e4-92c4-8300a86de1aa">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the CAT NMS Plan would produce data that would improve on current data sources because CAT Data would result in regulators having direct access to consolidated audit trail data, which would in turn improve many of the regulatory activities discussed in the Baseline Section.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz232-9" NAME="fr_pz232-9">2008</a> As summarized in Table 2, the Commission preliminarily concluded that the Plan would generate improvements in the quality of data that regulators would have access to in the areas of completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness. The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the improvements in the quality of regulatory data within these categories would significantly improve the ability of regulators to perform a wide range of regulatory activities, which would lead to benefits for investors and markets. In addition, the Commission preliminarily believed that certain provisions in the Plan&#8212;those related to future upgrades of the Central Repository, the promotion of the accuracy of CAT Data, the promotion of the timeliness of CAT Data, and the inclusion of specific governance provisions identified by the Commission in the Adopting Release for <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>&#8212;would increase the likelihood that the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan would be realized.</p>
        <p id="0f0efefa-f7d8-4824-9cbb-bf8f1cf5394c">In the category of completeness, the Commission discussed its belief that the ability for regulators to access more material data elements from a consolidated source would enable regulators to more efficiently carry out investigations, examinations, and analyses because regulators could acquire data from a single source that they would otherwise need to compile from many data sources. In the category of accuracy, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan would substantially improve data accuracy by requiring CAT Data to be collected, compiled, and stored in a uniform, linked format using consistent identifiers for customers and market participants. In the category of accessibility, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan would substantially improve the access to data for regulators because the Plan requires regulators to have direct access to CAT Data and this direct access would dramatically reduce the hundreds of thousands of requests that regulators must make each year in order to obtain data, thus reducing the burden on the industry. Finally, in the category of timeliness, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan, if approved as noticed, would significantly improve the timeliness of data acquisition and use, which could improve the timeliness of regulatory actions that use data.</p>
        <p id="93f5b670-3183-4a0a-b47f-24ad38eec219">The Commission discussed its expectation that regulatory activities such as surveillance, investigations, examinations, analysis and reconstruction of market events, and analysis in support of rulemaking initiatives would benefit from improved data quality as part of CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz234-5" NAME="fr_pz234-5">2009</a> The Commission explained that data is essential to all of these regulatory activities, and therefore substantial improvements in the quality of the regulatory data should result in substantial improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of these regulatory activities, which should translate into benefits to investors and markets. For example, improved data could lead to more effective and efficient surveillance that better protects investors and markets from violative behavior and facilitates more efficient and effective risk-based investigations and examinations that more effectively protect investors. The Commission stated that together, these improved activities could better deter violative behavior of market participants, which could improve market efficiency. Furthermore, this increase in directly accessible data should improve regulators&#8217; understanding of the markets, leading to more informed public policy decisions that better address market deficiencies to the benefit of investors and markets. The Commission also discussed the fact that the Plan lacked information regarding the details of certain elements of the Plan likely to affect the benefits of the Plan, primarily because many of those details had not yet been determined, which creates some uncertainty about the expected economic effects.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz234-6" NAME="fr_pz234-6">2010</a></p>
        <p id="277efd09-0b6d-4fff-aa6f-00294a1f6ca8">The Commission has considered the comments it received regarding the likely benefits of the CAT NMS Plan and continues to believe that the CAT NMS Plan would generate improvements in the quality of data that regulators would have access to in the areas of completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness. The Commission also continues to believe that improvements in the quality of regulatory data within these categories would significantly improve the ability of regulators to perform a wide range of regulatory activities, which would lead to benefits for investors and markets. In addition, the Commission continues to believe that certain provisions in the Plan&#8212;those related to future upgrades of the Central Repository, the promotion of the accuracy of CAT Data, the promotion of the timeliness of CAT Data, and the inclusion of specific governance provisions identified by the Commission in the Adopting Release for <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>&#8212;increase the likelihood that the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan described below will be realized. As set out in more detail below, the Commission has taken into account the modifications that have been made to the Plan where they are relevant to the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the benefits of the Plan, and has updated its analysis accordingly.</p>

          <p id="5ac74147-8bb2-48d0-a44c-d8c19a0e3650">a. Completeness</p>
          <p id="a3328903-310f-4401-83f3-24b6f0ea3bfa">In the Notice, the Commission discussed how the CAT NMS Plan, if approved, would result in regulators having direct access to a single data source that would be more complete than any current data source.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz238-10" NAME="fr_pz238-10">2018</a> The Commission discussed its belief that the CAT Data<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAntg" NAME="fr_pAntg">2019</a> would be more complete than other data sources because, compared to existing SRO audit trails and other data sources, the CAT Data would contain data from a greater number of broker-dealers on more event types, products, and data fields. While some current data sources contain many of the elements that would be included in CAT Data, the Commission explained that CAT Data would consolidate that data into one source that would be much more complete than any existing source, and that CAT Data would also include some elements that are not available from any current data source. In the Commission&#8217;s view, having this data consolidated in a single source would provide numerous benefits.</p>
          <p id="dbd79c8d-c3b1-4fed-9831-b2878d4c895e">(1) Events and Products</p>
          <p id="7f80f4ac-e343-4f8c-95e1-fdc077ddd97d">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the fact that the CAT Data would include events and products from all current SRO audit trails, combined into a single data source. In addition, it would include some off-exchange activity not captured on current SRO audit trails,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz239-4" NAME="fr_pz239-4">2020</a> as well as proprietary orders originated by a trading desk in the ordinary course of a member&#8217;s market making activities (or &#8220;principal activity&#8221;),<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz239-5" NAME="fr_pz239-5">2021</a> and information on equities, options and OTC Equity Securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz239-6" NAME="fr_pz239-6">2022</a></p>
          <p id="75f9c581-fb65-403b-b931-0e8b42b07bac">Four commenters believed that the CAT NMS Plan would result in a data source that is not complete enough and argued that CAT should be significantly expanded in scope to include additional event types, such as additional short selling information, clearing information, and ETF creation and redemption data; additional product types, such as stock index futures and options on index futures; or other types of regulatory submissions or metrics reports, such as CCAR/DFAST, TLAC, Volcker, Basel III, or BCBS-283.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz240-5" NAME="fr_pz240-5">2023</a></p>
          <p id="9ed970d3-097e-42f8-9966-795733bda3d5">The Commission recognizes that at least some of these expansions could potentially make CAT Data more complete and responds to each of the suggestions above in Section IV.D.4.f. At the same time, the Commission continues to believe that the CAT NMS Plan will result in regulators having direct access to a single data source that will be more complete than any current data source. Furthermore, the Commission continues to believe that the CAT Data will be more complete than other data sources because it will contain data from a greater number of broker-dealers on more event types and products when compared to existing SRO audit trails and other data sources.</p>
          <p id="03228b9c-2577-4927-a37f-2012c462d391">(2) Data Fields</p>
          <p id="0e2ad88c-6091-4917-b216-018e9b8a5cfa">In the Notice, the Commission also explained that the Plan would consolidate, in a single source, fields that currently may not be available from all data sources, including some fields that are difficult for regulators to compile.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAinFP" NAME="fr_pAinFP">2024</a> It discussed its belief that, in particular, the inclusion of consistent, unique customer information in the CAT Data represents a significant improvement over current SRO audit trails in terms of completeness because very few current data sources contain customer information, and those that do are limited in terms of the completeness and accuracy of this information, which significantly limits regulatory efficiency.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz241-3" NAME="fr_pz241-3">2025</a> As proposed in the Notice, CAT Data would also include other data fields not available from current SRO audit trails, including allocation information such as allocation time, open/close information, Quote Sent Time,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz241-4" NAME="fr_pz241-4">2026</a> and information on whether a Customer gave a modification or cancellation instruction. With respect to the rest of the data fields included in CAT Data, the Commission discussed the fact that certain of them are included in some or all current SRO audit trails but that no single current source contains all of them. For example, the inclusion of order display information (i.e., whether the size of the order is displayed or non-displayed) and special handling instructions in CAT Data improve completeness because they are not always mandatory in SRO audit trail data and therefore may not be consistently available without data requests to broker-dealers.</p>
          <p id="53e65e9e-a236-40f2-b6b8-1a436c1ab06b">The Commission discussed its belief that, while the costs and benefits of including particular fields can change due to technological advances and/or changes in the nature of markets, the Plan contains provisions regarding periodic reviews and upgrades to CAT that could lead to proposing additional data fields that are deemed important.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz241-5" NAME="fr_pz241-5">2027</a> In addition, the Commission noted that it had reviewed gap analyses that examine whether the CAT Data would contain all important data elements in current data sources, and that the Commission identified some potential data gaps.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-3" NAME="fr_pz242-3">2028</a> However, the Commission discussed the fact that the Plan provides that prior to the retirement of existing systems, CAT Data must contain data elements sufficient to ensure the same regulatory coverage provided by existing systems that are anticipated to be retired.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-4" NAME="fr_pz242-4">2029</a> The Commission discussed its expectation that, therefore, any missing elements that are material to regulators would be incorporated into the CAT Data prior to the retirement of the systems that currently provide those data elements to regulators.</p>
          <p id="be5de6c3-3474-4635-a1f2-3f7bddd4f190">Three commenters questioned the benefits of timestamps in the Allocation Report.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-5" NAME="fr_pz242-5">2030</a> One of the commenters stated that a requirement to report allocation time would be &#8220;divorced from the goals of CAT.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-6" NAME="fr_pz242-6">2031</a> Similarly, another commenter noted that allocation time would not provide the regulatory completeness benefit that the Commission is seeking because one likely definition would not capture what regulators would want.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-7" NAME="fr_pz242-7">2032</a> This commenter further argued that if the main regulatory purpose of including allocation timestamps is to detect cherry-picking, there could be alternate approaches that achieve the same result using existing data fields.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAWuY" NAME="fr_pAWuY">2033</a></p>
          <p id="7dd48b33-c6ac-48df-ab3a-97f7ba8e2368">Three commenters suggested that the open/close indicator for equities would be a new data field.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-4" NAME="fr_pz243-4">2034</a> However, these comments did not address the benefits of the open/close indicator that the Commission discussed in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="f5ae60ed-6749-4f5d-90f5-872508728371">One commenter discussed possible data gaps between CAT and current data sources.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-5" NAME="fr_pz243-5">2035</a> The commenter indicated that the OATS-CAT Gap Analysis, published in May 2015, is out of date because it does not reflect changes that have been incorporated into OATS since 2015 including additional fields to accommodate the Tick Size Pilot and ATS Order Book Reporting. The commenter also argued that gaps between OATS and CAT may widen further if changes to OATS continue to be made without corresponding changes to the CAT Plan for the initial phase. Furthermore, the commenter noted that other regulatory systems may indirectly impact CAT reporting requirements; for example, recent NYSE changes to the Account Type Indicator will require EBS changes, which in turn impacts CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-6" NAME="fr_pz243-6">2036</a></p>
          <p id="3a1b49d4-61f8-457f-b687-d63e6d7d2ea9">In their response, the Participants agreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice and expressed their belief that there are benefits associated with including time-stamps in the Allocation Report, including the detection of allocation fraud.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-7" NAME="fr_pz243-7">2037</a> With respect to the open/close indicator, the Participants noted that this data field is not captured pursuant to current industry practices for equities or some options transactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAKyGq" NAME="fr_pAKyGq">2038</a> The Participants also responded to the comment regarding the OATS-CAT Gap Analysis, stating that the gap analysis has been updated by including newly-added data fields in these duplicative systems, such as the new OATS data fields related to the Tick Size Pilot and ATS Order Book Reporting changes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz244-4" NAME="fr_pz244-4">2039</a></p>
          <p id="d41f6b74-6551-4299-8fdc-9224d25e65aa">The Commission has considered the comments it received and the Participants&#8217; response regarding the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan in terms of data completeness. The Commission disagrees with the comments that allocation timestamps are outside the goal of CAT and that they will not provide the Commission with the regulatory benefit that it is seeking. As discussed in the Notice and below, the Commission believes that allocation time is an important data field because it is critical in investigations of violations such as market manipulation and cherry-picking, and because allocation time is currently more difficult to acquire than the other information on the Allocation Report.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz244-5" NAME="fr_pz244-5">2040</a> The inclusion of this data field will improve the efficiency and efficacy of enforcement investigations for regulators, and this benefit is one of the goals of the CAT NMS Plan. With respect to the commenter who argued that alternate approaches that do not rely upon allocation timestamps can be used to detect cherry picking, the Commission notes that the commenter&#8217;s example requires an allocation time.</p>
          <p id="cb7c8e23-2274-4e96-9c2b-19142688aba4">Regarding the possibility of data gaps between CAT and current data sources, the Commission recognizes that there may be other gaps between current regulatory data sources and the Plan, in addition to those that the Commission mentioned in the Notice. The Commission also recognizes that the number and the scope of these gaps can change over time due to new regulatory developments. However, as discussed above, the Participants have stated that they have completed the gap analysis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz244-6" NAME="fr_pz244-6">2041</a> As set out in the Notice (and discussed above), the Plan specifically provides that, prior to the retirement of existing systems, CAT Data must contain data elements sufficient to ensure the same regulatory coverage as the coverage provided by these systems. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that any missing elements that are important to regulators would be incorporated into the CAT Data prior to the retirement of the systems that currently provide these data elements.</p>
          <p id="596cc471-e0b4-42d4-a5c0-630b43787615">The Commission is updating its analysis of these benefits to recognize two modifications to the Plan. First, modifications to the Plan to require the reporting of LEIs for Customers and Industry Members in certain circumstances<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz245-3" NAME="fr_pz245-3">2042</a> should result in regulators having access to more complete information identifying Customers and Industry Members. Second, the Plan has been modified to eliminate the requirement to report an open/close indicator for equities and Options Market Markers. The inclusion of this indicator for equities and Options Market Makers would have assisted regulators in determining when an investor was buying to cover a short sale in equities or identifying whether options market makers engage in aggressive risk-taking trading. Such information would have been useful in detecting certain market manipulations, violations of rules such as Rule 105, short sale marking rules, and Rule 204. The Commission now notes that, due to the elimination of the requirement to report an open/close indicator for equities and Option Market Makers as part of CAT, these benefits will no longer be realized. However, the Commission is approving the Plan with this modification for the reasons discussed in <a href="#680d0543-48a8-4476-a9a5-a8df56413598">Section IV.D.4.c</a>, above.</p>
          <p id="4a513100-5505-479f-9c07-dcc17511fb9b">b. Accuracy</p>
          <p id="bc17bed0-c602-4027-9126-7fb1b4cca70b">In the Notice, the Commission analyzed the expected effect of the CAT NMS Plan on the accuracy of data available to regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz246-7" NAME="fr_pz246-7">2043</a> The Commission preliminarily believed that the requirements in the CAT NMS Plan for collecting, consolidating, and storing the CAT Data in a uniform linked format, the use of consistent identifiers for Customers, and the focus on sequencing would promote data accuracy. However, in regard to certain Plan requirements, the Commission preliminary believed that improvements in data accuracy would be limited. For example, the Commission discussed its belief that the proposed clock synchronization requirements in the Plan would only lead to modest improvements in the percentage of sequenceable order events.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz246-8" NAME="fr_pz246-8">2044</a> Also, the Commission noted that the full extent of improvement that will result from the Plan was uncertain, because the Plan defers many decisions relevant to accuracy until the Plan Processor publishes the Technical Specifications and interpretations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz246-9" NAME="fr_pz246-9">2045</a></p>
          <p id="813e9334-38cc-435c-ad36-bd74bad3447f">(1) Definitions</p>
          <p id="5b409528-5422-4e8a-9cee-be1e1b3d5f95">As previously stated, the Plan defers many decisions relevant to accuracy until the Plan Processor publishes the Technical Specifications and interpretations. In particular, the CAT NMS Plan specifies that the &#8220;Technical Specifications shall include a detailed description of . . . each data element, including permitted values, in any type of report submitted to the Central Repository&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAn0f" NAME="fr_pAn0f">2046</a> and &#8220;the Plan Processor shall have sole discretion to amend and publish interpretations regarding the Technical Specifications.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz247-2" NAME="fr_pz247-2">2047</a> In the Notice, the Commission explained that this leaves open precise definitions and parameters for the data fields to be included in CAT Data. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz247-3" NAME="fr_pz247-3">2048</a> Nonetheless, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the Plan provides some procedural protections to mitigate this uncertainty and help promote accuracy. For example, the Plan requires that, at a minimum, the Technical Specifications be &#8220;consistent with [considerations and minimum standards discussed in] Appendices C and D,&#8221; and that the initial Technical Specifications and any Material Amendments thereto must be provided to the Operating Committee for approval by Supermajority Vote.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz247-4" NAME="fr_pz247-4">2049</a> Further, all non-Material Amendments and all published interpretations must be provided to the Operating Committee in writing at least ten days before publication, and shall be deemed approved unless two or more unaffiliated Participants call the matter for a vote of the full Operating Committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA17a" NAME="fr_pA17a">2050</a></p>
          <p id="e3d8a62a-6d0a-4eea-b04f-4ab3ad75d742">The Commission received comments about the lack of definitions for data fields in the Plan such as the open/close indicator,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-3" NAME="fr_pz248-3">2051</a> allocation time,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-4" NAME="fr_pz248-4">2052</a> account type,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-5" NAME="fr_pz248-5">2053</a> and customer type.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-6" NAME="fr_pz248-6">2054</a> Commenters argued that it is currently uncertain whether the Plan Processor will select definitions that are the most beneficial to regulators. For example, one commenter suggested that allocation time may be challenging to define, stating that &#8220;the industry does not have a standard business flow which consistently captures time at the same point in the allocation process.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-7" NAME="fr_pz248-7">2055</a> This commenter further pointed out that if allocation time is defined as the time the allocation is booked, &#8220;it will not provide the regulatory benefit expected by the SEC,&#8221; and provided an example of a way to detect allocation fraud using the time &#8220;when the allocation was submitted to move the shares into the intended subaccounts.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-8" NAME="fr_pz248-8">2056</a> The Participants responded to the comments regarding the definitions of allocation time, account type, and customer type by saying that the definitions will be addressed in the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz248-9" NAME="fr_pz248-9">2057</a></p>
          <p id="7ef3ec5c-5780-4abb-ab1f-86c6cb95d8d7">The Commission has considered the comments and believes they are consistent with the Commission&#8217;s assessment in the Notice that leaving open precise definitions, parameters, and interpretations for the data fields to be included in CAT Data creates uncertainty about the full extent of improvements in data accuracy. The Commission is cognizant of the complexity of certain data fields, such as allocation time. These complexities mean that the accuracy of the data fields depends on Plan Processor discretion, because the Plan Processor would have responsibility for defining the permitted values and interpreting when CAT Reporters would use such permitted values, and sometimes would not have guidance from previous data sources on how to define or interpret such a field.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz249-4" NAME="fr_pz249-4">2058</a> Although the Commission agrees that uncertainty exists in the selection of data definitions and that definitions ultimately selected may not promote accuracy as much as certain alternatives, as discussed in <a href="#e262eb9f-03d9-4064-9dc3-b273780fa7ba">Section V.G.4.a.(2)</a>, the Commission continues to believe that the existing process trades off the need for certainty with the benefits of an efficient process going forward. Further, for reasons discussed above in Section IV.B. and below in Section V.E.3.d, the Commission continues to believe that the Plan provides some procedural protections to mitigate this uncertainty and help promote accuracy.</p>
          <p id="fa4b1629-3ba5-4afb-848f-fcfa0faa87a9">(2) Data Errors</p>
          <p id="2d4e9943-dff7-487c-ad9d-4b788d4240c6">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the fact that the CAT NMS Plan specifies a high-level process for handling errors that includes target Error Rates for data initially submitted by CAT Reporters and a correction process and timeline, but explained that it is difficult to conclude whether the Error Rates and processes in the CAT NMS Plan would constitute an accuracy improvement as compared to current data sources. Specifically, because the current OATS error rate is below 1% and the Plan states that 5% is an appropriate initial Error Rate, the Commission preliminarily believed that the initial percentage of errors in CAT would be higher than the current percentage of errors in OATS, though the OATS error rate may not be directly comparable to the Error Rate in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz250-4" NAME="fr_pz250-4">2059</a> As discussed in the Notice, Error Rates for CAT Data may not be comparable to error rates in OATS because of the increased scope and level of linkages specified in the Plan and the new, large, and untested system.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz250-5" NAME="fr_pz250-5">2060</a></p>
          <p id="e29ec7de-de31-4773-b05b-b1705a7707fa">In the Notice, the Commission also discussed that the Plan contains some uncertainty about the level of the maximum Error Rate because the initial 5% rate is subject to a quality assurance testing period and subject to change again before each new batch of CAT Reporters are brought online. The Commission noted that in time, the rate could be lowered, but it also could be raised.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz250-6" NAME="fr_pz250-6">2061</a> Finally, the Commission discussed that the Plan specifies an error correction process and indicates that practically all errors identifiable by the validations used would be corrected by 8:00 a.m. ET on T+5, but that the Plan does not provide the level of detail necessary to verify whether the CAT validation process would run the same validations as OATS, whether current validations would be relevant, and what validations, if any, would be added.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz250-7" NAME="fr_pz250-7">2062</a></p>

While the Commission is concerned with the effect of the post-correction Error Rate on accuracy, it notes that, while uncertain, the Plan does require the Plan Processor to perform validations within three specific categories: File Validations (confirmation that the file is received in the correct format); Validation of CAT Data (checks of format, data type, consistency, range/logic, data validity, completeness, and timeliness); and Linkage Validation (checking the &#8220;daisy chain&#8221;).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-4" NAME="fr_pz3-4">2078</a> Specifically, in regard to Linkage Validation, the Plan seems to require validations that are more comprehensive than what FINRA runs on OATS data, where, as stated in the Notice, significant error rates in event linking are common because there is no cross-participant error resolution process.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-5" NAME="fr_pz3-5">2079</a> Further, the OATS error types described in the Baseline above<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-6" NAME="fr_pz3-6">2080</a> also suggest that the Plan&#8217;s validations will be more comprehensive than the validations run on OATS data.</p>

However, the Commission also explained that the benefits from the more granular timestamps could be limited by the level of clock synchronization required by the Plan. In particular, the Commission explained that timestamp granularity would not be the limiting factor in sequencing accuracy, because recording events with timestamps with resolutions of less than one millisecond cannot help to sequence events occurring on different venues with clocks that may be 100 milliseconds out of sync due to clock synchronization offsets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-4" NAME="fr_pz6-4">2088</a> Therefore, the benefits of timestamping order events at increments finer than a millisecond would be limited without also improving the clock synchronization standards of the Plan.</p>

The Commission is updating its economic analysis to incorporate these modifications to the Plan. The Commission agrees with the commenter who pointed out that millisecond timestamps are insufficient to show the precise timestamp of certain activities and disagrees with commenters who stated that millisecond precision is sufficient to sequence events. As stated in the Notice, the Commission believes that a 1 millisecond timestamp granularity offers benefits over the Baseline, but that a more granular timestamp requirement, coupled with a more stringent clock synchronization requirement, would be needed to completely sequence the majority of unrelated market events. In response to the commenters who questioned the benefits of reporting the sub-millisecond timestamps if CAT Reporters capture them, the Commission agrees with the Participants that such a requirement will increase the quality of data reported to the CAT.</p>
        <p id="887aa65d-4d9c-4de3-b255-fd5e9caa2a85">Modifications to the Plan now require Participants to adhere to a more stringent clock synchronization standard of 100 microseconds (or less), and CAT Reporters to record timestamps in finer increments than 1 millisecond if their systems utilize timestamps in such finer increments. Because, as discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ApIi" NAME="fr_ApIi">2106</a> Participants already operate pursuant to a clock synchronization standard of 100 microseconds with regard to their electronic systems, and because many Participants already report timestamps in microseconds and nanoseconds in their direct feeds and are currently required to report timestamps in microseconds for equity trades and quotes, the Commission does not believe the clock synchronization amendment to the Plan will result in large accuracy improvements over current standards for timestamp granularity. However, the Commission is approving the Plan without further modifications for the reasons discussed in Section IV.D.13, above.</p>
        <p id="ff10d35b-e6c9-493a-b596-49a69ec3d92d">In the Notice, the Commission did not explicitly consider timestamp granularity or clock synchronization standards for timestamps in Allocation Reports. However, in response to comments and modifications to the timestamp on Allocation Reports, the Commission now analyzes whether the modifications limit the improvements to accuracy. Based on the experience of its Staff, the Commission understands that allocations are conducted after a trade and that the allocation time can aid regulators in ways that do not require millisecond-level timestamps (or 50 millisecond clock offset tolerance). Further, the Commission agrees with the commenter&#8217;s argument that allocations are not time-sensitive and the benefits from allocation timestamps do not require millisecond precision. Therefore, the Commission believes that requiring allocation times to be recorded in milliseconds (with 50 millisecond offset tolerance) compared to seconds (with one second tolerance) would provide little, if any, additional regulatory benefit. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that this modification materially reduces the improvements to accuracy.</p>

As explained below, the Commission continues to believe that requirements in the Plan related to event sequencing would provide improvements in accuracy compared to what is currently achievable, but that improvements are modest and the requirements to the Plan may not be sufficient to completely sequence the majority of market events relative to all other events. Orders sent from different broker-dealers to different CAT Reporters can only be sequenced in CAT Data according to their timestamp. If the clocks of CAT Reporters are not synchronized with sufficient precision, it is impossible to definitively sequence these events. The Plan acknowledges this limitation and states, &#8220;[f]or unrelated events, e.g., multiple unrelated orders from different broker-dealers, there would be no way to definitively sequence order events within the allowable clock drift as defined in Article 6.8.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-3" NAME="fr_pz13-3">2118</a> The Commission disagrees with the comment that sequencing unrelated market events has no regulatory relevance. As discussed in the Notice, the ability to sequence market events is crucial to the efficacy of detecting and investigating some types of manipulation, particularly those involving high frequency trading, those in liquid stocks in which many order events can occur within microseconds, and those involving orders spread across various markets. The Commission also disagrees with this commenter&#8217;s assessment that more stringent clock synchronization standards would not increase the accuracy of the audit trail. As demonstrated by the Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice, if clock synchronization standards were made more stringent, some of the many market events at separate market centers that occur within small time windows would become sequenceable, which would increase the accuracy of the audit trail.</p>

Furthermore, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan would significantly improve the ability of regulators to link order events compared to OATS, and would link this activity to specific customers, unlike current audit trail data. However, the Commission also noted that the CAT NMS Plan does not provide sufficiently detailed information for the Commission to estimate the likely error rates associated with the linking process required by the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-3" NAME="fr_pz16-3">2126</a> Accordingly, while the centralized linking should generally promote efficiencies and accuracies, the Commission stated that these uncertainties make it difficult to gauge the degree to which the process for linking orders across market participants and SROs would improve accuracy compared to existing data, including OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-4" NAME="fr_pz16-4">2127</a></p>
        <p id="e75f0b02-6413-4f9b-9ef1-fa4df227f4a8">The Commission also explained that uncertainties prevented it from determining whether the process for converting data into a uniform format at the Central Repository would improve the accuracy of the data over existing audit trail accuracy rates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-5" NAME="fr_pz16-5">2128</a> The Plan includes two alternative approaches to data conversion. In the first, called Approach 1, CAT Reporters would submit data to the Central Repository in an existing industry standard protocol of their choice such as the Financial Information eXchange (&#8220;FIX&#8221;) protocol. In Approach 2, CAT Reporters would submit data to the Central Repository in single mandatory specified format, such as an augmented version of the OATS protocol. Under Approach 1, the data must be converted into a uniform format at the Central Repository in a second step. Under Approach 2, the data is already in a uniform format at the time of submission. The Plan defers the decision regarding which approach to take until the selection of a Plan Processor and the development of Technical Specifications. The Commission explained its preliminary belief that Approach 1 would likely result in a lower Error Rate than Approach 2 because of increased efficiency and accuracy due to specialization by the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-3" NAME="fr_pz17-3">2129</a> However, because of uncertainties regarding expected Error Rates and error rates in current data, the Commission was unable to evaluate the degree to which the approach would improve data accuracy relative to currently available data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AILh" NAME="fr_AILh">2130</a></p>
        <p id="80af2063-4a5c-4f8e-86cc-28e8d93298da">The Commission also discussed its belief that the Plan&#8217;s requirement for standardized Allocation Reports that consistently and uniquely identify Customers and CAT Reporters should improve the linkability of allocation information compared to current data, despite the limitation of direct linkage to order lifecycles, particularly in scenarios where potentially violative conduct is carried out by market participants operating through multiple broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AseO" NAME="fr_AseO">2131</a> The Commission stated that this moderate improvement in the linkability of allocation data should improve regulators&#8217; ability to identify market participants who commit violations related to improper subaccount allocations.</p>
        <p id="b94e96be-9761-44fb-b4f1-78020a869d1d">The Commission received two comment letters that agreed with the Commission&#8217;s assessment that Plan provisions related to data linking would increase the overall accuracy of data available to regulators. One of these commenters stated that, &#8220;the provisions in the CAT NMS Plan (linkage requirements, daisy chains, Firm Designated ID) will result in a more complete and accurate linking of order events across market participants and SROs.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-4" NAME="fr_pz18-4">2132</a> The other commenter agreed that data accuracy would improve.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-5" NAME="fr_pz18-5">2133</a></p>
        <p id="107da3e1-069e-41a8-bdd3-b7ab7fecb67a">Commenters also opined on whether data should be stored in a standardized format and on the relative economic effects of different approaches to data ingestion formats. One commenter stated that the Plan&#8217;s requirement to store data in a standardized format would increase accuracy within that format, but on the other hand, transformation by CAT Reporters could introduce errors during the data submission process.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-6" NAME="fr_pz18-6">2134</a> The commenter further stated that using original data reduces the chance of introducing noise.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-7" NAME="fr_pz18-7">2135</a> Several commenters indicated that existing and widely used formats or protocols for data ingestion would promote better data accuracy.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-8" NAME="fr_pz18-8">2136</a> Some also noted that without a uniform data ingestion format, data quality would suffer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-9" NAME="fr_pz18-9">2137</a></p>
        <p id="07f2df85-aa9d-4e10-ab3f-34f123be7696">The Commission received one comment related to the ability to link allocations under the Plan. Specifically, the commenter stated that an allocation report is &#8220;undeniably useful for analytic[al] purpose[s],&#8221; but noted challenges in linking account and subaccount information to which an execution is allocated.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz19-3" NAME="fr_pz19-3">2138</a></p>
        <p id="272e894c-6d45-4748-bbec-f165069650a1">The Commission has considered the comment letters received, and continues to believe that the requirements of the Plan related to data linking would result in improvements to the accuracy of the data available to regulators. The Commission agrees with the commenter who stated that transforming data into a uniform format can introduce errors, but the Commission believes such errors will be less common and severe than those introduced currently by multiple regulators independently linking together many different data sources with different formats.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ADp5" NAME="fr_ADp5">2139</a> The Commission agrees with the commenters that stated requiring existing and widely used formats for data ingestion would promote the accuracy of data. Because the Plan does not mandate an ingestion format, uncertainty exists as to what ingestion format (or formats) will be required and whether the ingestion format(s) ultimately selected will promote accuracy as much as alternatives. The Commission acknowledges this uncertainty. In response to the commenters that stated that data quality would suffer without a uniform data ingestion format, as specified in Approach 2, the Commission continues to believe that the benefits to data accuracy are potentially greater using Approach 1, where data is ingested in an existing industry standard protocol of the submitter&#8217;s choice and subsequently converted to a uniform format at the Central Repository. The Commission believes this approach is more likely to benefit data accuracy because, as stated by a commenter, allowing the use of original data eliminates the introduction of errors and specialization by the Plan Processor should keep to a minimum the number of errors introduced during the conversion process.</p>
        <p id="0421a0b0-5214-4888-8c16-3759d13e4430">With regards to the commenter who noted the challenges in linking allocation and subaccount information with executions using the Plan&#8217;s approach, the Commission agrees that this approach may result in certain drawbacks, such as having access to less accurate allocation linkages compared to the approach under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, which required a link between allocations and executions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-6" NAME="fr_pz20-6">2140</a> However, the Commission continues to believe, as set out in the Notice, that the Plan&#8217;s Allocation approach will provide regulators with the necessary information to detect abuses in the allocation process without placing undue burdens on broker-dealers.</p>

        <p id="498de1eb-dd60-4e23-a7bd-3df36b14ec3d">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the inclusion of the unique Customer and CAT Reporter Identifiers described in the CAT NMS Plan would increase the accuracy of customer and broker-dealer information in data regulators use and provide benefits to a broad range of regulatory activities that involve audit trail data. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz21-3" NAME="fr_pz21-3">2141</a> The Commission explained that it is currently difficult for regulators to identify the trading of a single customer across multiple market participants because many existing data sources use inconsistent definitions and mappings across market centers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz21-4" NAME="fr_pz21-4">2142</a> In addition, the Commission discussed how the Customer Information Approach specified in the CAT NMS Plan requires the Plan Processor to create a unique Customer-ID that would be consistent across that Customer&#8217;s activity regardless of the originating broker-dealer.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz21-5" NAME="fr_pz21-5">2143</a> The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the Customer-ID approach constitutes a significant improvement relative to the Baseline because it would consistently identify the Customer responsible for market activity, obviating the need for regulators to collect and reconcile Customer Identifying Information from multiple broker-dealers.</p>
        <p id="0c013251-ffa4-432d-a762-17d80693a6ae">Also, in the Notice, the Commission discussed the challenges that regulators face in tracking broker-dealers&#8217; activities across markets due to inconsistent identifiers and a lack of a centralized database.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz21-6" NAME="fr_pz21-6">2144</a> The CAT NMS Plan calls for the use of CAT-Reporter-IDs, which would be assigned to each CAT Reporter by the Plan Processor in the CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AoFA" NAME="fr_AoFA">2145</a> In the Notice, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the existing identifier approach specified in the CAT NMS Plan would improve the accuracy of tracking information regarding entities with reporting obligations, namely broker-dealers and SROs.</p>
        <p id="3e86cc85-f0d7-4fd0-bce3-34e15f07b596">One commenter stated that there are &#8220;flaws to the approaches of CAT Customer and Reporter Identifiers, thus it has little benefit to improve the accuracy of information.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz22-3" NAME="fr_pz22-3">2146</a> The commenter, however, did not list these flaws and did not provide specific reasons why the identifiers would not improve data accuracy. Another commenter stated that assigning a unique ID to &#8220;every person that ever trades a security&#8221; could render the data difficult to use, and that greater difficulties could arise from allowing broker-dealers to assign their own unique customer IDs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aay" NAME="fr_Aay">2147</a> However, the commenter did not specify in detail what difficulties would arise or why the data would be difficult to use. That commenter noted that unique IDs for every client might be unnecessary, and suggested applying them only to those with a certain threshold of trading activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AN0j" NAME="fr_AN0j">2148</a> Two commenters suggested that the use of the LEI would improve the accuracy of Customer Identifying Information. One commenter suggested that using LEIs would allow market participants to be &#8220;easily identified,&#8221; and also suggested that the LEI should be used to identify customers in conjunction with other recognized personal identifiers, to promote accurate identification.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ATQ8" NAME="fr_ATQ8">2149</a> Another stated that using the LEI would allow for &#8220;unambiguous identification&#8221; of entities submitting information to the CAT system and would allow the SEC &#8220;to be clear about the identity of entities it is monitoring.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Akpi" NAME="fr_Akpi">2150</a></p>

Based on information provided by commenters who suggested the inclusion of LEI,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-4" NAME="fr_pz24-4">2158</a> supplemented by Commission Staff experience, the Commission believes that the inclusion of an LEI in CAT Data will improve the accuracy of CAT Data by enabling the linking of the data to other data sources such as foreign jurisdictions and domestic data not included in CAT at this time (e.g., futures and security-based swaps), as LEIs become more widely used by regulators and the financial industry. In addition, the Commission expects the modification to improve the accuracy of the data by providing more information about the identities of Industry Members and Customers, including &#8211; as the LEI system starts to collect parent and subsidiary information &#8211; their relationships with other entities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AZlL" NAME="fr_AZlL">2159</a> The Commission notes, however, that the benefits of the LEI information will be limited insofar as the reporting of an LEI is required for Industry Members only where the Members already have an LEI, and for Customers only where the Customer has an LEI and the Industry Member has or acquires the LEI.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-5" NAME="fr_pz25-5">2160</a></p>

        <p id="ea400218-9f21-4b90-8b8b-ce7c5cf7a69c">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief that most CAT Data would be disaggregated data and that therefore the CAT Data would not suffer from the limitations of the aggregated data sources that regulators must currently use.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-6" NAME="fr_pz25-6">2161</a> Currently, subaccount allocation data and issuer repurchase data exist in forms that are aggregated and thus these data sources are limited for use in certain regulatory activities and interests.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-7" NAME="fr_pz25-7">2162</a> In particular, neither data type may necessarily indicate the individual executions. The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the CAT NMS Plan would improve the accuracy of allocation data compared to existing data available to regulators, because it would provide disaggregated information on the identity of the security, the number of shares and price allocated to each subaccount, when the allocation took place, and how each Customer subaccount is associated with the master account. This would more accurately reflect which Customer ultimately received the shares that were purchased in a particular trade. The Commission anticipated that regulators may use CAT Data for some purposes that they use cleared data for now because the CAT Data would be significantly less aggregated. Finally, the Commission discussed its belief that because the Plan would require that the Plan Processor link Customer information to the order lifecycle and the report would identify as Customers those issuers that are repurchasing their stock in the open market,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-6" NAME="fr_pz26-6">2163</a> CAT Data would be more accurate and more granular and there would be more data than what is available currently for open market issuer repurchases, which consists of monthly aggregations of those issuer repurchases.</p>
        <p id="0ddf7304-b6a5-412d-873b-138fb46a032c">The Commission did not receive any comments regarding its analysis of data aggregation in the Notice, the Participants&#8217; response did not specifically address its analysis of data aggregation, and the Commission does not believe that modifications to the Plan warrant changes to this aspect of the economic analysis. The Commission continues to believe that CAT Data would constitute an improvement over current data sources because it would be disaggregated data that would not suffer from the limitations that characterize some of the aggregated data sources that regulators must currently use. Specifically, the Commission continues to believe that the Plan would promote more effective and efficient investigation by regulators of subaccount allocation issues and issuer repurchase activity.</p>

        <p id="1665398e-2d91-497d-8e68-c5d7fda8818d">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan, if approved, would substantially improve the accessibility<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AejD" NAME="fr_AejD">2164</a> of regulatory data by providing regulators with direct access to the consolidated CAT Data, including some data elements that currently take weeks or months to obtain. However, the Commission also explained that there is some uncertainty regarding the process for regulatory access under the Plan, which creates uncertainty as to the degree of the expected improvement.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Au6Y" NAME="fr_Au6Y">2165</a></p>
        <p id="40c045ed-f742-46b8-b495-e5299f03cf5d">(1) Direct Access to Data</p>
        <p id="513c0e2f-6a85-4418-a26d-2359b68863d3">The Commission recognized in the Notice that improving accessibility of regulatory data relative to the Baseline requires ensuring that enough SRO and Commission Staff members are able to use the direct access system supplied by the Central Repository when they need it. The Commission discussed its belief that the ability to use the direct access system depends, among other things, on how user-friendly the system is, whether it has enough capacity for the expected use of the system, and whether it contains the functionality that the SRO and Commission Staff require. However, the Commission preliminarily believed that &#8220;the minimum requirements for the direct access system ensure that the Plan will improve on the Baseline of access to current data, including the process of requesting data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-4" NAME="fr_pz27-4">2166</a></p>
        <p id="c6bbf7dd-f490-44c7-ab07-0cce1602f4dc">In the Notice, the Commission discussed in detail the minimum functional and technical requirements, as set out in Appendix D of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-5" NAME="fr_pz27-5">2167</a> In terms of capacity, the Commission noted, among other things, that the Central Repository must be able to support a minimum of 3,000 regulatory users within the system, 600 of which might be accessing the system concurrently (which must be possible without an unacceptable decline in system performance). In terms of functionality, the Commission noted that two types of query interfacing must be supported&#8212;an online targeting query tool and a user-defined direct query tool that allows for bulk extraction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-6" NAME="fr_pz27-6">2168</a> The Commission further noted that all queries must be able to be run against raw (i.e., unlinked) or processed data, or both, and that a variety of minimum performance metrics apply to those queries.</p>
        <p id="b7ce3a6f-922b-4110-b3c4-5e467042d70f">The Commission noted that the direct access facilitated by provisions of the CAT NMS Plan is reasonably designed to substantially reduce the number of ad hoc data requests and provide access to substantial data without the delays and costly time and knowledge investments associated with the need to create and respond to data requests.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aymh" NAME="fr_Aymh">2169</a> The Commission believed that this would dramatically reduce the hundreds of thousands of requests that regulators must make each year in order to obtain data, thus reducing the burden on the industry. For example, the Commission noted that regulators do not have direct access to EBS or trade blotter data and therefore they must request such data when needed for regulatory tasks. As a result, in 2014 the Commission made 3,722 EBS requests that generated 194,696 letters to broker-dealers for EBS data. Likewise, the Commission understood that FINRA requests generate about half this number of letters. In addition, the Commission noted that for examinations of investment advisers and investment companies, it makes approximately 1,200 data requests per year. The Commission also discussed its belief that, in addition to decreasing the amount of time currently required for regulators to access data sources, direct access to the CAT Data should decrease the costs that many regulators and market participants incur in either requesting data or fulfilling requests for data. Furthermore, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan would also permit regulators to directly access customer information, which could improve the ability of SROs to conduct surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-3" NAME="fr_pz29-3">2170</a></p>
        <p id="d73db5fc-8e17-42f2-bcb4-4ea85d934453">The Commission also discussed its belief that in some dimensions of accessibility, uncertainties exist that could affect the degree of the expected improvement to accessibility. In particular, while the Plan provides detail on the method of access and the types of queries that regulators could run, many of the decisions regarding access have been deferred until after the Plan Processor is selected and finalizes the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Au7v" NAME="fr_Au7v">2171</a> For instance, decisions regarding exactly how regulators would access the data beyond providing them with query tools; how user-friendly these tools will be; whether the Plan Processor would host a server workspace that regulators could use; and whether regulators can perform dynamic searches, data extraction, and offline analysis have not yet been decided. Nonetheless, the Commission stated that the requirements included in the Plan describe a system that, once implemented, would result in the ability to query consolidated data sources, which represents a significant improvement over the currently available systems. This substantial reduction in data delays and costly data investments would permit regulators to complete market reconstructions, analyses, and research projects, as well as investigations and examinations, more effectively and efficiently, and would lead to improved productivity in the array of regulatory matters that rely on data, which should lead to improved investor protection.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A8D" NAME="fr_A8D">2172</a></p>

        <p id="f8a6149f-917b-4b3f-b251-a68f953746fd">In their response, the Participants argued that the Plan does provide sufficient detail regarding regulatory access to CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ApUM" NAME="fr_ApUM">2185</a> In particular, the Participants noted that Section 8 of Appendix D of the Plan describes various tools that will be used for surveillance and analytics. In addition, the Participants noted that the Plan states that the Plan Processor will provide an open API that allows regulators to use analytic tools and will permit regulators to use ODBC/JDBC drivers to access the CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-4" NAME="fr_pz32-4">2186</a></p>
        <p id="a767fad4-a3c5-46b9-b390-8a05f44afd8a">The Commission has considered the comments it received regarding the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan in terms of the accessibility of regulatory data, as well as the Participants&#8217; response. Commenters did not provide any additional information or analysis that changes the Commission&#8217;s conclusions as set out in the Notice, and there have been no modifications to the Plan that would warrant changes.</p>
        <p id="0c756480-c825-43d2-aadc-2bf398da7796">With respect to the comment that an online targeted query tool and a user-defined direct query tool will not enable regulatory Staff to use CAT Data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-5" NAME="fr_pz32-5">2187</a> the Commission disagrees with the commenter&#8217;s assertion that regulators cannot benefit from direct access to CAT Data unless CAT embeds real-time analytics. In the Notice, the Commission discussed two ways in which regulators could benefit from having direct access to CAT Data facilitated by the availability of an online targeted query tool and a user-defined direct query tool.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aggj" NAME="fr_Aggj">2188</a> First, direct access to CAT Data could substantially reduce the number of ad hoc data requests and decrease the costs that many regulators currently incur in requesting data. Second, the Plan would permit regulators to directly access customer information, which could improve the ability of SROs to conduct surveillance, among other benefits discussed below.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-4" NAME="fr_pz33-4">2189</a> Because these benefits of direct access do not depend on the ability of CAT to embed real-time analytics, the Commission continues to believe that the methods of direct access specified in the Plan will improve the accessibility of regulatory data relative to the Baseline.</p>
        <p id="28a8ebbc-834e-4d31-a481-bbf7a7325271">With respect to the comment that the reduction in the number of data requests would result in cost savings to SROs of &#8220;about 5%,&#8221; but &#8220;definitely not more than 10%,&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-5" NAME="fr_pz33-5">2190</a> the Commission notes that the commenter did not explain the basis for its estimate. The Commission acknowledged in the Notice that it lacks the necessary information to estimate the magnitude of these cost savings, and this continues to be the case, as the Commission has not received any additional information it can use to estimate the savings. However, the Commission continues to believe that direct access to CAT Data should decrease the costs that many regulators and market participants incur in either requesting data or fulfilling requests for data.</p>
        <p id="67d0a129-92f8-4daa-9742-2d2294f3c762">With respect to the comments about uncertainties regarding the process for regulatory access to CAT Data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AbWT" NAME="fr_AbWT">2191</a> the Commission agrees with the commenter that, as discussed in the Notice, there is some uncertainty regarding the process for regulatory access under the Plan. The Commission notes that while the Plan provides detail on the method of access and the type of queries that regulators could run, many of the decisions regarding access have been deferred until after the Plan Processor is selected and finalizes the Technical Specifications. In particular, as discussed in the Notice, the details of functionality and performance of the final CAT System are still to be determined.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-4" NAME="fr_pz34-4">2192</a> The Commission continues to believe that these functionality and performance uncertainties create some uncertainty regarding the degree of improvement in regulatory access that will result from the Plan. The Commission agrees that is possible that, as one commenter noted,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-5" NAME="fr_pz34-5">2193</a> the deferral of these decisions could result in a delay in regulators&#8217; ability to access the CAT Data. However, the Commission continues to believe that the Plan will substantially improve the accessibility<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-6" NAME="fr_pz34-6">2194</a> of regulatory data relative to the Baseline by providing regulators with direct access to the CAT Data.</p>
        <p id="53a4c3c9-f45b-4038-b218-f568b3079f19">(2) Consolidation of Data</p>
        <p id="b02ab0f9-1726-41f9-8f32-e6f73c4d8be5">In the Notice, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the Plan would improve accessibility by consolidating various data elements into one combined source, reducing data fragmentation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-7" NAME="fr_pz34-7">2195</a> Currently, audit trail data for securities that are traded on multiple venues (multiple exchanges or off-exchange venues) is fragmented across multiple data sources, with each regulator generally having direct access only to data generated on the trading venues it regulates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-8" NAME="fr_pz34-8">2196</a> The Commission explained that the Plan would bring audit trail data related to trading on all venues into the Central Repository where it could be accessed by all regulators. Additionally, the Commission noted that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> requires that the Plan include both equity and options data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-7" NAME="fr_pz35-7">2197</a> Because no existing regulatory audit trail data source includes both options and equities data, the Notice discussed the fact that collecting this data and providing access would allow regulators to monitor and run surveillance on the activity of market participants in related instruments, such as when a market participant has activity in both options and the options&#8217; underlying assets. The Commission noted that the Plan would also marginally increase the accessibility of historical exchange data. In particular, Section 6.5(b)(i) of the Plan requires that the Central Repository make historical data available for not less than six years, in a manner that is directly accessible and searchable electronically without manual intervention by the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-8" NAME="fr_pz35-8">2198</a></p>
        <p id="381dc060-cc13-4554-abd9-00ee97f3e7bf">The Commission did not receive any comments on this aspect of accessibility, and there have not been any modifications to the Plan related to this aspect of the Commission&#8217;s analysis. The Commission therefore continues to believe that the Plan will improve accessibility relative to the Baseline by consolidating various data elements into one combined source, reducing data fragmentation.</p>
        <p id="313daa3f-983f-4aa9-8535-b2801c6c91a1">d. Timeliness</p>
        <p id="bb9e7c21-2bcb-46bf-8ce5-90b814930a3f">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief that, if approved, the CAT NMS Plan would significantly improve the timeliness<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-3" NAME="fr_pz36-3">2199</a> of reporting, compiling, and accessing regulatory data, which would benefit a wide array of regulatory activities that use or could use audit trail data. The Commission discussed its belief that the timeline for compiling and reporting data pursuant to the Plan would constitute an improvement over the processes currently in place for many existing data sources and that, relative to some data sources, the improvement would be dramatic. Specifically, under the Plan, CAT Data would be compiled and made ready for access faster than is the case today for some data, both in raw and in corrected form; regulators would be able to query and manipulate the CAT Data without going through a lengthy data request process; and the data would be in a format to make it more immediately useful for regulatory purposes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-4" NAME="fr_pz36-4">2200</a></p>
        <p id="52daa9cd-e09b-45ad-9fd1-5833142b3601">In terms of initial access to the data, the Commission discussed its belief that the Plan would require CAT Reporters to report data to the Central Repository at times that are on par with current audit trails that require reporting, but the Central Repository would compile<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-5" NAME="fr_pz36-5">2201</a> the data for initial access sooner than some other such data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aq2h" NAME="fr_Aq2h">2202</a> For example, equity and option clearing data currently are not compiled and reported to the NSCC and the OCC until T+3, and data in EBS reports are not compiled and reported to a centralized database until a request is received.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-3" NAME="fr_pz37-3">2203</a> OATS data is initially reported to FINRA by 8:00 a.m. ET on the calendar day following the reportable event, and it takes approximately 24 hours for FINRA to run validation checks on the file, though SROs do not currently access OATS information for regulatory purposes until after the error correction process is complete.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-4" NAME="fr_pz37-4">2204</a></p>
        <p id="47d24a53-24f7-44bc-9089-516bf5b387b3">Furthermore, the Commission discussed the fact that, to the extent that access to the raw (i.e., uncorrected and unlinked) data would be useful for regulatory purposes, the CAT NMS Plan provides a way for SROs and the Commission to access the uncorrected and unlinked data on T+1 by 12:00 p.m. ET at the latest.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-5" NAME="fr_pz37-5">2205</a> Under the Plan, this access would be at least several days sooner than OATS is available to non-FINRA regulators. In the Notice, the Commission acknowledged that the Plan would not necessarily improve the timeliness of audit trail data in every case or for every regulator. For example, exchange SROs already have real-time access to their own audit trail data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-6" NAME="fr_pz37-6">2206</a> However, regulators at other SROs or the Commission do not have real-time access to that audit trail data, and therefore the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that CAT Data could be more timely for these other regulators to access and use than obtaining that exchange&#8217;s audit trail data through other means.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-3" NAME="fr_pz38-3">2207</a></p>
        <p id="343edbb5-9ffd-4c8e-a1ab-91952a435251">In terms of timeliness of access to error-corrected data, the Commission stated in the Notice that it preliminarily believed that the error correction process required by the CAT NMS Plan is reasonably designed to provide additional improvements in timeliness for corrected data. The Plan specifies that the initial data validation and communication of errors to CAT Reporters must occur by noon on T+1 and that corrections of these errors must be submitted by the CAT Reporters to the Central Repository by 8:00 a.m. ET on T+3, with the corrected data made available to the regulators by 8:00 a.m. ET on T+5.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-4" NAME="fr_pz38-4">2208</a> During this interim time period between initial processing and corrected data availability, &#8220;all iterations&#8221; of processed data must be available for regulatory use.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-5" NAME="fr_pz38-5">2209</a> The Central Repository must be able to receive error corrections at any time, even if late;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-6" NAME="fr_pz38-6">2210</a> if corrections are received after T+5, the Plan Processor must notify the SEC and SROs of this fact and describe how re-processing of the data (to be determined in conjunction with the Operating Committee) would be completed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Af6T" NAME="fr_Af6T">2211</a> Customer information (i.e., information containing PII) is processed along a slightly different timeline, but the outcome&#8212;corrected data available by 8:00 a.m. ET on T+5&#8212;is the same.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-3" NAME="fr_pz39-3">2212</a> One exception to this timeline is if the Plan Processor has not received a significant portion of the data, as determined according to the Plan Processor&#8217;s monitoring, in which case the Plan Processor could determine to halt processing pending submission of that data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-4" NAME="fr_pz39-4">2213</a> The Commission noted that the error resolution process for OATS is limited to five business days from the date a rejection becomes available.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-5" NAME="fr_pz39-5">2214</a> The CAT NMS Plan requires a three-day repair window for the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-6" NAME="fr_pz39-6">2215</a> Accordingly, the Commission stated that if the Plan were approved, regulators would generally be able to access partially and fully corrected data earlier than they would for OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-7" NAME="fr_pz39-7">2216</a></p>
        <p id="7fcee3de-2227-4537-972b-8cd5e75828ed">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief that improvements to timeliness would also result from the ability of regulators to directly access CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-8" NAME="fr_pz39-8">2217</a> The Commission discussed the fact that most current data sources do not provide direct access to most regulators and explained that data requests can take as long as weeks or even months to process. Other data sources provide direct access with queries that can sometimes generate results in minutes&#8212;for example, running a search on all MIDAS message traffic in one day can take up to 30 minutes<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-9" NAME="fr_pz39-9">2218</a>&#8212;but only for a limited subset of the data to be available in CAT and generally only for a limited number of regulators. Accordingly, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the ability of regulators to directly access and analyze the scope of audit trail data that would be stored in the Central Repository should reduce the delays that are currently associated with requesting and receiving data. Furthermore, the Commission discussed its belief that direct access to CAT Data should reduce the costs of making ad hoc data requests, including costs arising from extensive interactions with data liaisons and IT staff at broker-dealers, SROs, and vendors, developing specialized knowledge of varied formats, data structures, and systems, and reconciling data.</p>
        <p id="fd8f41f0-96ec-4625-813e-51bcd73469aa">The Commission also stated that it preliminarily expected that the CAT NMS Plan would reduce the time required to process data before analysis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-3" NAME="fr_pz40-3">2219</a> The Commission explained that currently, regulators can spend days and up to months processing data they receive into a useful format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-4" NAME="fr_pz40-4">2220</a> Part of this delay is due to the need to combine data across sources that could have non-uniform formats and to link data about the same event both within and across data sources. These kinds of linking processes can require sophisticated data techniques and substantial assumptions and can result in imperfectly linked data. The Commission noted that the Plan addresses this issue by stating that the Plan Processor must store the data in a linked uniform format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-5" NAME="fr_pz40-5">2221</a> Specifically, the Commission discussed how the Central Repository will use a &#8220;daisy chain&#8221; approach to link and reconstruct the complete lifecycle of each Reportable Event, including all related order events from all CAT Reporters involved in that lifecycle. Therefore, regulators accessing the data in a linked uniform format would no longer need to take additional time to process the data into a uniform format or to link the data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-3" NAME="fr_pz41-3">2222</a> Accordingly, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the Plan would reduce or eliminate the delays associated with merging and linking order events within the same lifecycle and that the Plan would improve the timeliness of FINRA&#8217;s access to the data it uses for much of its surveillance by several days because the corrected and linked CAT Data would be accessible on T+5 compared to FINRA&#8217;s T+8 access to its corrected and linked data combining OATS with exchange audit trails.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_APa2" NAME="fr_APa2">2223</a></p>
        <p id="843852a5-fa9d-468c-9510-08115fef921f">The Commission also discussed its belief that the expected improvements to data accuracy could result in an increase in the timeliness of data that is ready for analysis, although uncertainty exists regarding the extent of this benefit. The Commission explained that regulators currently take significant time to ensure data is accurate beyond the time that it takes data sources to validate data and that, in some cases, data users may engage in a lengthy iterative process involving a back and forth with the staff of a data provider in order to obtain accurate data necessary for a regulatory inquiry. Accordingly, the Commission stated that, to the extent that the Central Repository&#8217;s validation process is sufficiently reliable and complete, the duration of the error resolution process regulators would perform with CAT Data may be shorter than for current data. Further, to the extent that the Central Repository&#8217;s linking and reformatting processes are sufficiently successful, the SROs and Commission may not need a lengthy process to ensure the receipt of accurate data. However, the Commission noted that it lacked sufficient information on the validations, linking, and reformatting processes needed to draw a strong conclusion as to whether users would take less time to validate CAT Data than they take on current data. Nonetheless, the Commission preliminarily believed that the linking and reformatting processes at the Central Repository would be more accurate than the current decentralized processes such that it would reduce the time that regulators spend linking and reformatting data prior to use.</p>
        <p id="dc842ca8-b81e-4f8a-a93b-55deba5bc52e">The Commission received comments on the improvements in timeliness from the Plan. Two commenters suggested that CAT Data would not be timely enough because it is reported too late.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-4" NAME="fr_pz42-4">2224</a> One commenter called the reporting deadline (8:00 a.m. ET on T+1) an &#8220;extraordinarily lax reporting time frame.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-5" NAME="fr_pz42-5">2225</a> Another commenter argued that the T+5 schedule for regulatory access to corrected CAT Data is &#8220;useless in terms of effective market surveillance in prevention of threats to the U.S. financial stability&#8221; because a &#8220;huge loss can be accumulated within [a] split-second&#8221; and &#8220;market collapse does not take more than one day.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-6" NAME="fr_pz42-6">2226</a> Furthermore, although the commenter agreed that &#8220;CAT offers the regulators on-demand query of delayed data that saves them multiple trips to request data from the financial institutions,&#8221; he opined that this &#8220;does not necessarily mean timeliness improvement.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AJYfq" NAME="fr_AJYfq">2227</a></p>
        <p id="a7cfa533-0ac7-4a1b-98f3-00d96f3b098f">The Participants&#8217; response provided additional information on error correction timelines for customer information and PII. Specifically, the Participants&#8217; response identified an errant discussion of these error correction timelines in the Plan, and clarified that the Plan Processor must validate customer data and generate error reports no later than 5:00 p.m. ET on T+1, and stated that they believe the two day period for error correction is sufficient for CAT Reporters to correct errors in customer data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-4" NAME="fr_pz43-4">2228</a></p>
        <p id="6417b7ef-a280-4b90-8a4d-16a6ecc2a837">The Commission has considered the comments it received regarding the potential of the Plan to improve timeliness.

        <p id="625d40ce-456d-4866-8e6c-06a9a946bf81">The Commission disagrees with the commenter that characterized the next day reporting of CAT Data as an &#8220;extraordinarily lax reporting time frame,&#8221; and with the commenter that argued that the T+5 schedule for regulatory access to corrected CAT Data is insufficient.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_APX7" NAME="fr_APX7">2229</a> As discussed further above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Arrf" NAME="fr_Arrf">2230</a> the Commission considered whether CAT Reporters should be required to report data in real-time when it adopted <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> under Regulation NMS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-5" NAME="fr_pz43-5">2231</a> While the Commission acknowledged that there might be advantages to receiving data intraday, the Commission stated that the greater majority of benefits that may be realized from development of the CAT do not require real-time reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A0K4" NAME="fr_A0K4">2232</a> Furthermore, many SROs have real-time access to data generated on exchanges they operate, and can and do use this data for real-time surveillance of activity occurring on those exchanges As discussed in the Notice, the T+5 schedule improves the timeliness of regulatory access to corrected data relative to the Baseline in two ways.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-4" NAME="fr_pz44-4">2233</a> First, corrected OATS data is currently available to FINRA at T+8.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz44-5" NAME="fr_pz44-5">2234</a> Under the Plan, regulators will be able to access corrected CAT Data three days earlier than that (i.e., T+5).

        <p id="c92aa512-2dd5-42f9-bfc3-2811fdb825e2">The Commission also disagrees with the comment that the ability of regulators to directly access CAT Data will not result in improvement in timeliness.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AkQn" NAME="fr_AkQn">2236</a> The comment does not dispute that data requests can take time to process and it does not provide any specificity in arguing that direct access would not improve timeliness that undermines the Commission&#8217;s belief that direct access will make CAT Data up to many weeks more timely. This represents an important improvement in timeliness over the Baseline.</p>
        <p id="a63ac640-9fc3-463d-b17c-a0027912372c">Regarding the Participants&#8217; response, the Commission does not believe the clarification regarding the timeline for communication of errors for customer and account information would warrant changes to its analysis or conclusions regarding timeliness.

          <p id="675298b8-b1f0-4981-89f6-4feea0f9dab6">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that improvements in the quality of available data have the potential to result in improvements in the analysis and reconstruction of market events; market analysis and research in support of regulatory decisions; and market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement functions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AsLY" NAME="fr_AsLY">2241</a> The Commission discussed its belief that the ability of regulators to perform analyses and reconstruction of market events would likely improve if the CAT NMS Plan were approved, because it would allow regulators to provide investors and other market participants with more timely and accurate explanations of market events, and to develop more effective responses to such events. Furthermore, availability of CAT Data would benefit market analysis and research in support of regulatory decisions, by facilitating an improved understanding of markets that will inform potential policy decisions. The Commission also discussed how regulatory initiatives that are based on an accurate understanding of underlying events and are narrowly tailored to address any market deficiency should improve market quality and benefit investors.</p>
          <p id="07076fc1-4f22-4e05-b188-7e1dce7f715e">The Commission also explained that, in its preliminary view, the Plan would substantially improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of SRO broad market surveillance, which could benefit investors and market participants by allowing SROs to more quickly and precisely identify and address a higher proportion of market violations that occur, as well as prevent violative behavior through deterrence.</p>
          <p id="0639f3df-8148-4887-a678-2e00d885d470">The Commission discussed in the Notice its expectation that CAT Data would enhance the SROs&#8217; and the Commission&#8217;s abilities to effectively target risk-based examinations of market participants who are at elevated risk of violating market rules, as well as their abilities to conduct those examinations efficiently and effectively, which could also contribute to the identification and resolution of a higher proportion of violative behavior in the markets. Accordingly, the reduction of violative behavior in the market should benefit investors by providing them with a safer environment for allocating their capital and making financial decisions, and it could also benefit market participants whose business activities are harmed by the violative behavior of other market participants. The Commission further discussed how more targeted examinations could benefit market participants by resulting in proportionately fewer burdensome examinations of compliant market participants.</p>
          <p id="b7b5c966-43ad-48c0-a42d-0690e93a7471">The Commission also explained that a significant percentage of Commission enforcement actions involve trade and order data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-3" NAME="fr_pz47-3">2242</a> and that it preliminarily believed CAT Data would significantly improve the efficiency and efficacy of enforcement investigations by the Commission and SROs, including insider trading and manipulation investigations.</p>
          <p id="6728bf43-7db2-4c57-8349-971a158163df">The Commission also stated that it as well as the SROs anticipated additional benefits associated with enhanced abilities to handle tips, complaints and referrals, and improvements in the speed with which they could be addressed, particularly in connection with the significant number of tips, complaints, and referrals that relate to manipulation, insider trading, or other trading and pricing issues.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz47-4" NAME="fr_pz47-4">2243</a> The Commission explained that the benefits to investor protection of an improved tips, complaints, and referrals system would largely mirror the benefits to investor protection that would accrue through improved surveillance and examinations efficiency.</p>
          <p id="90b43f9d-07fb-42b0-9276-edee46148891">As discussed more fully below, the Commission has considered the comments it received regarding the likely benefits to regulatory activities, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan, and continues to believe that the CAT NMS Plan would generate improvements to regulatory activities, particularly in the analysis and reconstruction of market events; market analysis and research in support of regulatory decisions; and market surveillance, examinations, investigations, and other enforcement activities.</p>
          <p id="eefbbac6-a0eb-4675-b2a2-e44b3f362900">a. Analysis and Reconstruction of Market Events</p>
          <p id="c4e0bcd1-d80b-4b9c-a7de-3f7f929bc593">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the reasons for its preliminary belief that the Plan would improve regulators&#8217; ability to perform analysis and reconstruction of market events.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-6" NAME="fr_pz48-6">2244</a> As noted in the Adopting Release, the sooner regulators can complete a market reconstruction, the sooner regulators can begin reviewing an event to determine what happened, who was affected and how, if any regulatory responses might be required to address the event, and what shape such responses should take.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-7" NAME="fr_pz48-7">2245</a> Furthermore, the improved ability for regulators to generate prompt and complete market reconstructions could provide improved market knowledge, which could assist regulators in conducting retrospective analysis of their rules and pilots.</p>
          <p id="656feb23-f4b7-4eb4-a0f6-76838808ab54">The Commission discussed how the fragmented nature of current audit trail data and the lack of direct access to such data renders market reconstructions cumbersome and time-consuming.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-8" NAME="fr_pz48-8">2246</a> Currently, the information needed to perform these analyses is spread across multiple audit trails, with some residing in broker-dealer order systems and trade blotters. Requesting the data necessary for a reconstruction of a market event often takes weeks or months and, once received, regulators then need weeks to reconcile disparate data formats used in different data sources. Some of the most detailed data sources, including sources like EBS and trade blotters that identify customers, are impractical for broad-based reconstructions of market events. In particular, including EBS data for a reconstruction of trading in the market for even one security on one day could involve many, perhaps hundreds, of requests, and would require linking that to SRO audit trail data or public data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-4" NAME="fr_pz49-4">2247</a> Further, because EBS data lacks timestamps for certain trades,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-5" NAME="fr_pz49-5">2248</a> the Commission discussed how the use of EBS data in market reconstructions requires supplementation with data from other sources, such as trade blotters.</p>
          <p id="65252a1f-d92c-4061-b084-20a9fdd65ae6">The Commission stated that it expected that improvements in data completeness and accuracy from the Plan would enhance regulators&#8217; ability to perform analyses and to reach conclusions faster in the wake of a market event by reducing the time needed to collect, consolidate and link the data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz50-3" NAME="fr_pz50-3">2249</a> Specifically, the inclusion of Customer-IDs and consistent CAT-Reporter-IDs in the CAT Data would allow regulators to more effectively and efficiently identify market participants that submit orders through several broker-dealers and execute on multiple exchanges and whose activity may warrant further analysis. The Commission discussed its belief that this would be useful if regulators were interested in determining if a particular trader or category of traders had some role in causing the market event, or how they might have adjusted their behavior in response to the event, which could amplify the effects of the root cause or causes. Furthermore, the Commission discussed how the clock synchronization requirements of the Plan would improve the ability of regulators to sequence some events that happened in different market centers to better identify the causes of market events. Overall, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the CAT NMS Plan would dramatically improve the ability of regulators to identify the market participants involved in market events.</p>
          <p id="6cfd6676-cb64-4f49-aea7-7eaabf773830">The Commission also preliminarily believed that better data accessibility from the Plan would significantly improve the ability of regulators to analyze and reconstruct market events. Because CAT Data would link Reportable Events, the Plan could allow regulators to respond to market events more rapidly because they would not need to process corrected and linked data before starting their analyses.</p>
          <p id="ddb29a88-6c3a-401c-bbd1-fbdb7ff23cb9">The Commission received one comment on the fragmented nature of current audit trail data and the potential benefits of CAT Data to improve the ability of regulators to perform analysis and reconstructions of market events. That commenter agreed with the Commission that the fragmented nature of current data sources poses challenges to regulators seeking complete data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-3" NAME="fr_pz51-3">2250</a> however, the commenter also stated that the potential benefits that CAT Data would provide regulators in terms of conducting analysis and market reconstructions are minimal.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-4" NAME="fr_pz51-4">2251</a> The Participants did not provide responses to these concerns.</p>
          <p id="543e8248-ea23-410a-95d2-7e7de364f4ee">In the Commission&#8217;s view, this comment did not provide any additional information or analysis that warrants changes to the analysis or conclusions in the Notice. The commenter stated that &#8220;the plan is majoring in the minors (i.e., overemphasis on storage, and not enough coverage of pattern recognition).&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-5" NAME="fr_pz51-5">2252</a> The Commission disagrees. While the Commission has emphasized aspects of storage as in the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz51-6" NAME="fr_pz51-6">2253</a> the Commission has also emphasized that improvements in data completeness and accuracy would greatly assist regulators in performing analyses and reconstructing market events. The inclusion of Customer-IDs and CAT-Reporter-IDs would assist regulators in determining if particular traders had some role in causing a market event, and further, inclusion of these IDs could help regulators study patterns in customer-specific trading behavior. Further, enhanced clock synchronization requirements would assist regulators in sequencing events that happened in different market centers and help them to better identify the causes of market events. As such, the Commission continues to believe that the CAT NMS Plan would provide benefits in terms of performing analysis and reconstructing market events.</p>
          <p id="c374a170-f795-490c-abf8-f7ec7a2aa089">Changes to the Plan do affect data completeness and accuracy, as well as regulators&#8217; ability to analyze and reconstruct market events. First, the Commission has modified the Plan to require the reporting of LEIs for Customers and Industry Members in certain circumstances.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz52-6" NAME="fr_pz52-6">2254</a> These requirements will result in a greater ability of regulators to accurately identify traders that cause market events.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz52-7" NAME="fr_pz52-7">2255</a> Second, removing the open/close indicator for equities and Options Market Makers may reduce the completeness of CAT Data and may reduce the benefits that this potentially provides in terms of analysis and market reconstructions. Third, requiring exchanges to synchronize their clocks within 100 microseconds of NIST should enhance regulators&#8217; abilities to sequence events and reconstruct market events to a greater degree than initially stated in the Notice, though as discussed above in <a href="#2c850ebc-af8b-4434-b003-cd97d27bdc5b">Section V.E.1.b.(3)</a>, the Commission does not expect a large improvement relative to what was described in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="3a1a6f84-b927-468f-95a7-e3cb0881f944">b. Market Analysis and Research</p>
          <p id="a6cb4891-d6b0-4f9a-af9b-0589b8034f4e">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the reasons for its preliminary belief that the CAT NMS Plan would benefit the quality of market analysis and research that is produced to increase regulatory knowledge and support policy decisions and would lead to a more thorough understanding of current markets and emerging issues.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz52-8" NAME="fr_pz52-8">2256</a> The Commission discussed how improvements in regulatory market analysis and research aimed at informing regulatory decisions would benefit investors and market participants by improving regulators&#8217; understanding of the intricacies of dynamic modern markets and how different market participants behave in response to policies and information. These more nuanced and more thorough insights would help regulators to identify the need for regulation that specifically tailors policy to the diverse landscape of market participants and conditions that characterize current financial markets, as well as assist them in conducting retrospective analysis of their rules and pilots.</p>
          <p id="164601ab-d278-4339-8daa-203170bf79f1">As described in the Notice, the lack of direct access to necessary data, along with inaccuracies in the data that are available, currently limits the types of analyses that regulators can conduct. These data limitations constrain the information available to regulators when they are considering the potential effects of regulatory decisions. The CAT NMS Plan would provide direct access to data that currently requires an often lengthy and labor-intensive effort to request, compile, and process, including data that regulators could use to more directly study issues such as high frequency trading, maker-taker pricing structures, short selling, issuer repurchases, and ETF trading. Furthermore, the Commission discussed how CAT Data would better inform SROs and the Commission in rulemakings and assist them in conducting retrospective analysis of their rules and pilots, and how it would allow SROs to examine whether a rule change on another exchange was in the interest of investors and whether to propose a similar rule on their own exchange.</p>
          <p id="11932c0c-363d-47d5-8d6e-8e306c24a30c">The Commission received two comments regarding the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan to help the Commission perform market analyses and conduct research. One commenter misinterpreted what accessibility to CAT Data means for the Commission, stating that access to the CAT system and data is limited to its regulatory functions and could exclude analytical or academic needs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-3" NAME="fr_pz54-3">2257</a> Another commenter disagreed with the Commission&#8217;s findings and stated that the CAT Plan would provide little benefit to facilitating market analysis and research absent real-time access to intra-day feeds.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-4" NAME="fr_pz54-4">2258</a></p>
          <p id="294f80a3-abef-4410-ae76-e0d4c0a91b63">Commenters did not provide any additional information or analysis, however, and the Participants did not provide responses providing information relevant to this issue. The Commission is not changing its analysis and conclusions in light of the aforementioned comments for several reasons. First, one of the commenters assumes a narrow definition of &#8220;regulatory functions&#8221; but that CAT Data would serve the Commission and SROs in their analytical needs to conduct market analysis and academic research.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz54-5" NAME="fr_pz54-5">2259</a> Second, the Commission believes that even without real-time access to intra-day feeds, access to CAT Data would nonetheless benefit regulators since the quality of market analysis and research that is produced to increase regulatory knowledge would improve relative to the Baseline. Furthermore, the Commission continues to believe its statement in the Adopting Release that the majority regulatory benefits gained from the creation of a consolidated audit trail, as described in the Proposing Release,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-3" NAME="fr_pz55-3">2260</a> do not require real-time reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-4" NAME="fr_pz55-4">2261</a> Specifically, the Commission notes that market analysis and research does not require contemporaneous access to CAT Data, and therefore, it is not necessarily the case that real-time access to CAT Data, as opposed to the Plan requirement of access to corrected data at T+5, would provide more benefit to market analysis and research by regulators. As such, the Commission continues to believe that CAT Data would provide significant improvements to market analysis and research conducted by regulators.</p>
          <p id="26420f06-58fc-4ede-84ed-7c8277d99369">The Commission notes, however, that changes to the CAT NMS Plan do alter the analysis regarding the benefits for regulators in terms of conducting market analysis and research. In our view, the modifications to the Plan to require the reporting of LEIs for Customers and Industry Members in certain circumstances<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-5" NAME="fr_pz55-5">2262</a> should result in a greater ability of regulators to conduct analysis and research involving individual market participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-6" NAME="fr_pz55-6">2263</a> Specifically, the reporting of LEI would also make it possible to merge CAT Data with other data sources that are currently not part of CAT (e.g., futures and security-based swaps), and this could potentially help with market reconstructions involving these products. Furthermore, more granular clock synchronization requirements for exchanges would mean that regulators could sequence events with greater granularity, which could potentially benefit analysis that requires sequencing events and research surrounding high frequency traders. However, because the Plan no longer contains an open/close indicator for equities, regulators will not be able to distinguish buying activity that covers short positions from buying activity that establishes or increases long positions and, therefore, regulators would not be able to examine, for example, how long particular types of traders hold a short position, as indicated in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-5" NAME="fr_pz56-5">2264</a></p>
          <p id="20f81e2a-a79a-4697-a608-a94dc36d5fd1">c. Surveillance and Investigations</p>
          <p id="11e30e1f-bcd7-4032-b47b-ee0404c7eab9">In the Notice, the Commission explained the reasons for its preliminary belief that the enhanced surveillance and investigations made possible by the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan could allow regulators to more efficiently identify and investigate violative behavior in the markets and could also lead to market participants that currently engage in violative behavior reducing or ceasing such behavior, to the extent that such behavior is not already deterred by current systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-6" NAME="fr_pz56-6">2265</a> The Commission discussed how potential violators&#8217; expected probability of being caught influences their likelihood of committing a violation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-7" NAME="fr_pz56-7">2266</a> If market participants believe that the existence of CAT, and the improved regulatory activities that result from improvements in data and data processes, increase the likelihood of regulators detecting violative behavior, they could reduce or eliminate the violative activity in which they engage to avoid incurring the costs associated with detection, such as fines, legal expenses, and loss of reputation. Such a reduction in violative behavior would benefit investor protection and the market as investors would no longer bear the costs of the violative behavior that would otherwise exist in the current system. Many of the improvements that would result from CAT could also allow regulators to identify violative activity, such as market manipulation, more quickly and reliably, which could improve market efficiency by deterring market manipulation and identifying and addressing it more quickly and more often when it occurs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz57-5" NAME="fr_pz57-5">2267</a></p>
          <p id="bb04d6c8-03e9-444f-824b-5af52b22c52e">The Commission received several comments on the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan to improve SRO surveillance, risk-based examinations, enforcement activity, and the process for evaluating tips and complaints; and the Participants also responded to some of the comments raised in the comment letters. As discussed below, the Commission is not changing its analysis and conclusions in light of these comments and the Participants&#8217; responses; however, changes to the Plan affect the analysis that the Commission laid out in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="e595fb01-926f-41a8-b760-7c9904fdd471">(1) SRO Surveillance</p>
          <p id="e442465c-6bc1-4c81-bb95-46296e20f49b"><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(f)</a> requires SROs to implement surveillances reasonably designed to make use of the CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AuMkq" NAME="fr_AuMkq">2268</a> Further, data improvements resulting from the Plan would improve regulators&#8217; ability to perform comprehensive and efficient surveillance. As the Commission explained in detail in the Notice, these benefits would encompass a number of improvements including: detection of insider trading; surveillance of principal orders; and cross-market and cross-product surveillance; and other market surveillance activities, which are each described in more detail below.</p>
          <p id="dd610e3d-c46b-4d8e-8ad6-3d73ea3cf197">First, the Commission noted that CAT Data would include additional fields not currently available in data used for surveillance. Since currently available data does not include customer identifiers, SROs performing insider trading and manipulation surveillance are unable to identify some suspicious trading<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz58-4" NAME="fr_pz58-4">2269</a> and must undertake multiple steps to request additional information after identifying suspect trades. The inclusion of Customer-IDs in the CAT would significantly improve these surveillance capabilities. The ability to link uniquely identified customers with suspicious trading behavior would provide regulators with a better opportunity to identify the distribution of suspicious trading instances by a customer as well as improve regulators&#8217; ability to utilize customer-based risk assessment.</p>
          <p id="ed7f30cf-77c5-4c7a-80fb-b5ba7b0b9de5">Second, the Commission noted that some current data sources used for SRO surveillance exclude unexecuted principal orders, limiting the surveillance for issues such as wash sales. As a result, many surveillance patterns are unable to detect certain rule violations involving principal orders. The inclusion of principal orders of Industry Members in the CAT would therefore enable regulators to better identify rule violations by broker-dealers that have not previously had to provide audit trail data on unexecuted principal orders.</p>
          <p id="a54b52ee-a63b-4a1c-9985-4dc04c777243">Third, the Commission noted that the Plan would improve regulators&#8217; efficiency in conducting cross-market and cross-product surveillance, and enable any regulator to surveil the trading activity of market participants in both equity and options markets and across multiple trading venues without data requests. Regulators would also have access to substantially more information about market participants&#8217; activity,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-2" NAME="fr_pz59-2">2270</a> and the requirement that the data be consolidated in a single database would assist regulators in detecting activity that may appear permissible without evaluating data from multiple venues.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-3" NAME="fr_pz59-3">2271</a> The Commission explained that because market data are fragmented across many data sources and because audit trail data lacks consistent customer identifiers, regulators currently cannot run cross-market surveillance tracking particular customers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-4" NAME="fr_pz59-4">2272</a> Furthermore, routine cross-product surveillance is generally not possible with current data. The Commission concluded that the potential enhancements in market surveillance enabled by the CAT NMS Plan are likely to result in more capable and efficient surveillance which could reduce violative behavior and protect investors from harm.</p>
          <p id="c739b43f-a5dd-4e6c-a363-8c755c3ae9c1">Two commenters stated that the Commission is overly optimistic as to the benefits that the Plan would provide to SRO surveillance activities,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-4" NAME="fr_pz60-4">2273</a> with one of the commenters also mentioning that the Commission is overly optimistic with respects to the benefits to surveillance. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-5" NAME="fr_pz60-5">2274</a> One of the commenters argued that benefits are exaggerated because the Plan lacks an analytical framework embedded in its design.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-6" NAME="fr_pz60-6">2275</a> The same commenter mentioned that the lack of an analytical framework embedded in the design of CAT reduces the ability to identify false positives (i.e., detection of behaviors that are not violative), and false negatives (i.e., not detecting behaviors that are violative).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-7" NAME="fr_pz60-7">2276</a> The commenter also specifically raised concerns that the current accessibility and functionality requirements of CAT Data would be rendered unusable for regulators because the methods for querying data and performing bulk extracts are &#8220;generic&#8221; and not fit for financial market surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-8" NAME="fr_pz60-8">2277</a></p>
          <p id="51c594db-3b0b-4354-bdd7-35411bfbeb0b">Two commenters stated that CAT should encompass real-time reporting functionality, because without it, it is hard to conduct meaningful surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-9" NAME="fr_pz60-9">2278</a> Additionally, one commenter mentioned that the Plan does not provide details on how regulators would use CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AdP1" NAME="fr_AdP1">2279</a></p>
          <p id="5156d37f-0c3f-4910-a4fa-5de9f4a65af9">The Participants responded to these comments and noted that they already have real-time surveillance and monitoring tools in place for the respective markets that will not be affected by CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz61-3" NAME="fr_pz61-3">2280</a> Furthermore, the Participants noted that the Plan Processor will provide sufficient data access tools as well as analytical tools in the CAT for the Participants to satisfy their obligations as set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(f)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz61-4" NAME="fr_pz61-4">2281</a> But the Participants did note that surveillance methods and techniques could vary over time and across Participants,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz61-5" NAME="fr_pz61-5">2282</a> potentially yielding some degree of uncertainty in how benefits to surveillance activities would accrue to SROs, investors and market participants. The Participants also noted that CAT is not intended to be the sole source of surveillance for each Participant, and therefore, would not cover all surveillance methods currently employed by the Participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AZsE" NAME="fr_AZsE">2283</a></p>
          <p id="c5c4a1b2-05cc-45ba-a986-1bfea2260d9e">The Commission considered these comments and the Participants&#8217; responses and believes that they would not warrant changes to the Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusions of the benefits that the Plan would provide to SRO surveillance. But the Commission does acknowledge that there is some uncertainty particularly regarding how exactly the SROs will incorporate CAT into their surveillance activities. First, while the Commission agrees that surveillance methods differ across Participants and this could generate uncertainty in the benefits, the Commission disagrees with the commenters that stated that the Commission is overly optimistic as to the benefits. Access to CAT Data would result in substantial benefits to SRO surveillance for the reasons mentioned earlier in this Section, none of which are undermined by the comments. Second, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that stated that the benefits that would accrue to surveillance are exaggerated due to the Plan&#8217;s lack of an analytical framework embedded in its design. The commenter assumes that if the Plan had an analytical framework, the benefits of CAT would be more realistic. The Commission notes that the Plan does have an analytical framework embedded in its design. The Plan states specifically that the Plan Processor will provide the following analytical framework&#8212;namely an API that allows regulators to use analytical tools (e.g., R, SAS, Python, Tableau) and permit regulators to use ODBC/JDBC drivers to access CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz62-2" NAME="fr_pz62-2">2284</a> This analytical framework would benefit SROs in conducting surveillance, which would benefit investors and market participants by allowing regulators to more quickly and precisely identify and address a higher proportion of market violations that occur, as well as prevent violative behavior through deterrence. Third, this analytical framework could allow regulators to code computer programs using CAT Data to detect trading patterns indicative of violative behavior. While there might be potential errors in detecting violative behavior using these programs, that is, false positives (detecting non-violative behavior) and false negatives (not detecting violative behavior), having access to more detailed CAT Data in a consolidated source including timestamps, principal orders, non-member activity, and subaccount allocations could minimize those errors. Fourth, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that the methods for querying data and performing bulk extracts are &#8220;generic&#8221; and not fit for financial market surveillance. The Commission expects these query methods, generic or not, will facilitate the direct access necessary for SROs to build improved surveillances. For instance, the Plan states that CAT will support two types of query interfacing,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz62-3" NAME="fr_pz62-3">2285</a> and specifies that all queries must be able to be run against raw (i.e., unlinked) or processed data, or both.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz62-4" NAME="fr_pz62-4">2286</a> Furthermore, by using the query interfacing supported by CAT, regulators would be able to directly query Customer-IDs, which could improve the ability for SROs to conduct surveillance, contrary to what the commenter stated.</p>
          <p id="12715b0f-c5db-4bcf-ac1a-1ad8f784c585">The Commission considered the comments on real-time surveillance, and understands that from the Participants&#8217; response, some SROs already have real-time surveillance. Further, the Commission expects the Plan to improve on SROs&#8217; real-time surveillances because the Plan will result in exchanges receiving, even at a later date, additional fields in the Material Terms of the Order, such as special order handling instructions, and additional order events, such as principal orders, that some SROs currently do not have available for any surveillance, real-time or otherwise.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz63-4" NAME="fr_pz63-4">2287</a></p>
          <p id="5c4e29da-9b20-41da-8cc3-e04e47fec366">Finally, in response to the commenter that claimed the Plan did not provide enough details on how regulators would use CAT Data, the Commission acknowledges that there is uncertainty as to how the SROs will incorporate CAT Data into their surveillance activities. The Commission believes that even if there is uncertainty in this regard, the SROs nonetheless would still be able to conduct &#8220;meaningful&#8221; surveillance with the opportunity to improve on their current surveillances. In this regard, the Commission notes that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(f)</a> states that national securities exchanges should create surveillances that are &#8220;reasonably designed to make use of consolidated information in the consolidated audit trail.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AflI" NAME="fr_AflI">2288</a> In addition, the Plan will improve the ability of regulators to perform cross-market and cross-product surveillance because regulators will have direct access to consistent data that includes comprehensive trade and order data in markets for multiple products.</p>
          <p id="16ba614b-34b6-46f7-9f0b-08c0b24e8f19">The Commission also notes that the changes to the Plan to require the reporting of LEIs for Customers and Industry Members in certain circumstances<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz64-6" NAME="fr_pz64-6">2289</a> should facilitate improved SRO surveillance by enabling SROs to identify traders and their clients with more accuracy.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz64-7" NAME="fr_pz64-7">2290</a> The reporting of LEIs would also make it possible to merge CAT Data with markets not included in CAT at this time (e.g., futures and security-based swaps), which could potentially assist with surveillance activities involving these products. Therefore, the inclusion of LEI for Customers and Industry Members could result in greater benefits to SRO surveillance than those described in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="81f4d85a-72f8-4381-8d8a-4a66eff7380e">(2) Examinations</p>
          <p id="de1504d9-7b2f-464c-9ef3-be4f9be41ef2">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the availability of CAT Data would also improve examinations by the Commission and SROs and that these improvements would benefit investor protection, and the market in general, by resulting in more effective supervision of market participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz64-8" NAME="fr_pz64-8">2291</a> The Commission conducted 493 broker-dealer examinations in 2014 and 484 in 2015, 70 exams of the national securities exchanges and FINRA in 2014 and 21 in 2015. In addition, the Commission conducted 1,237 investment adviser and investment company examinations in 2014 and 1,358 in 2015. Virtually all investment adviser examinations and a significant proportion of the Commission&#8217;s other examinations involved analysis of trading and order data. Currently some data that would be useful to conduct risk-based selection for examinations, such as trade blotters, are not available in data sources available for pre-exam analysis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz65-3" NAME="fr_pz65-3">2292</a> Further, the Commission explained that data available during exams often require regulatory Staff to link multiple data sources to analyze customer trading. For example, some customer identities are present in EBS data, but timestamps are not. To evaluate the execution price a customer received, it is necessary to know the time of the trade to compare the price of the customer&#8217;s execution with the prevailing market prices at that time, which requires linking the EBS data with another data source that contains trades with timestamps (such as the trade blotter). These linking processes can be labor-intensive and require the use of algorithms that may not link with 100% accuracy.</p>
          <p id="071d8674-bd4e-4b82-8fd6-bc074c8c1789">The Commission explained in the Notice that the expected improvements in the data qualities discussed above would enhance the ability of regulators to select market participants for focused examinations on the basis of risk. Having direct access to consolidated data in the Central Repository would improve regulators&#8217; ability to efficiently conduct analyses in an attempt to select broker-dealers and investment advisers for more intensive examinations based on identified risk. Additionally, the Commission discussed its belief that regulators would be able to conduct certain types of exams more efficiently because of the inclusion of Customer-IDs in CAT. Moreover, the clock synchronization provisions of the Plan could aid regulators in sequencing some events more accurately, thereby facilitating more informed exams. The Commission believed that the Plan would allow the data collection portion of examinations to be completed more quickly with fewer formal data requests, and that more efficient examinations would help regulators better protect investors from the violative behavior of some market participants and could reduce examination costs for market participants who would have otherwise faced examinations that are less focused and more lengthy.</p>
          <p id="7bc36edb-a135-4912-8126-78a35f60ba9e">One commenter suggested that without &#8220;red-flagging&#8221; suspicious activities using the commenter&#8217;s recommended approach (using real-time analytics),<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz66-4" NAME="fr_pz66-4">2293</a> it would not be possible to facilitate the ability of regulators to conduct risk-based examinations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz66-5" NAME="fr_pz66-5">2294</a> The same commenter stated that the Commission has an overly optimistic assessment of the economic effects to examinations, mainly due to the Plan lacking an analytical framework embedded in its design.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A8hg" NAME="fr_A8hg">2295</a> The Participants did not provide a response to this comment.</p>
          <p id="dd6c59f5-698d-43f5-9fd9-07fa6e335d91">The Commission considered these comments, but believes that they do not warrant changes to the Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusions of the benefits that the Plan would provide to performing risk-based examinations. First, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that stated &#8220;red-flagging&#8221; suspicious activity using their recommended approach (using real-time analytics) is the only way to facilitate risk-based examinations. As discussed above, having access to Customer-IDs would assist the Commission in flagging suspicious activity for their risk-based examinations, and assist the Commission in effectively targeting risk-based examinations of market participants who are at elevated risk of violating market rules. Furthermore, the Commission could also conduct more informed risk-based exams under the Plan because enhanced clock synchronization provisions could aid the Commission in sequencing some events more accurately. Second, regarding the commenter who stated that the Commission&#8217;s assessment of the effects to examinations are optimistic because the Plan lacks an analytical framework, the Commission disagrees with this commenter for similar reasons to those stated above.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz67-6" NAME="fr_pz67-6">2296</a></p>
          <p id="94893048-810a-46b8-b073-8e5f20fd7b1c">While the commenters did not provide any additional information that would warrant changes to the Commission&#8217;s analysis or conclusions as set out in the Notice, changes in the Plan do alter the Commission&#8217;s preliminary analysis. Requiring CAT Reporters to report their LEI for Customers and Industry Members in certain circumstances<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz67-7" NAME="fr_pz67-7">2297</a> should result in a greater ability for regulators to identify traders for the purposes of risk-based examinations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz67-8" NAME="fr_pz67-8">2298</a> Additionally, more stringent clock synchronization requirements for exchanges should enhance regulators&#8217; abilities to sequence events, thereby facilitating more informed risk-based exams. As such, the Commission believes that changes to the Plan could generate additional benefits over and above those stated in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="296e11ca-8dd5-4fea-9e24-a10e2314d1ff">(3) Enforcement Investigations</p>
          <p id="3b888feb-9f1e-4984-ab2d-aa27d6a29d93">In the Notice, the Commission explained that the improvements in data qualities that would result from the CAT NMS Plan would significantly improve the efficiency and efficacy of enforcement investigations, including insider trading and manipulation investigations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A8Iz" NAME="fr_A8Iz">2299</a> The Commission discussed how more efficient and effective enforcement activity is beneficial to both investors and market participants because it deters violative behavior that degrades market quality and that imposes costs on investors and market participants.</p>
          <p id="533a4c25-f2d8-45c2-8514-5174474621c8">The Commission discussed its expectation that dramatic benefits would come from improvements to the accessibility, timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the data. First, compiling the data to support an investigation often requires a tremendous amount of time and resources, multiple requests to multiple data sources and significant data processing efforts, for both SROs and the Commission. While SROs have direct access to the data from their own markets, their investigations and investigations by the Commission often require access to the data of other SROs because firms trade across multiple venues. Some enforcement investigations, including those on insider trading and manipulation, require narrow market reconstructions that allow investigators to view actions and reactions across the market. Data fragmentation and the time it takes to receive requested data currently make these market reconstructions cumbersome and time-consuming. The Commission discussed its view that having access to CAT Data would help regulators analyze and reconstruct market events, and could in turn help them detect violative behavior during enforcement investigations.</p>
          <p id="a5a04c81-1b91-4a0e-8b14-9cb4ee1ea8c3">Second, the Commission explained that it currently takes weeks or longer to process, link and make data available for analysis in an enforcement investigation. Under the CAT NMS Plan, data for an enforcement investigation initiated five days or more after an event would be processed, linked, and available for analysis within 24 hours of a query. The Commission discussed how the enhanced timeliness of data can improve the Commission&#8217;s chances of preventing asset transfers from manipulation schemes, because regulators could use even uncorrected data (between T+1 and T+5) to detect the manipulation and identify the suspected manipulators.</p>
          <p id="1931c732-fbc9-4b7d-8929-67792f14ad11">Third, the Commission explained in the Notice that currently, identifying the activity of a single market participant across the market is cumbersome and prone to error. The inclusion and expected improvement in the accuracy of Customer Identifying Information in the CAT NMS Plan could allow regulators to review the activity of specific market participants more effectively. The Commission also explained that this information would be helpful in identifying insider trading, manipulation and other potentially violative activity that depends on the identity of market participants. Additionally, the Commission explained that improved accuracy with respect to timestamp granularity could increase the proportion of market events that could be sequenced under the CAT NMS Plan. This could yield some benefits in enforcement investigations, including investigations of insider trading, manipulation, and compliance with <a href="https://gov.ecfr.io/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=baae5e3ff19d674418fbd7489535560e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1201&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 201 of Regulation SHO</a> and <a href="https://gov.ecfr.io/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=baae5e3ff19d674418fbd7489535560e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1611&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 611 of Regulation NMS</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz69-4" NAME="fr_pz69-4">2300</a></p>
          <p id="67844805-7913-43b8-ab0c-4c931f90d5a8">Finally, the Commission explained that the expected improvements in completeness could also benefit investigations by allowing regulators to observe in a consolidated data source relevant data that are not available in some or all current data sources, including timestamps, principal orders, non-member activity, customer information, allocations, and an open/close indicator, which would identify whether a trade increases or decreases an existing position. This data could be important, for example, when investigating allegations of market manipulation or cherry-picking in subaccounts.</p>
          <p id="a86e4a88-0d86-493d-8f23-b7c0d1624db6">One commenter agreed that the CAT Plan would slightly improve the efficiency of regulators&#8217; enforcement activities because CAT will save them multiple trips to request data from financial institutions;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-3" NAME="fr_pz70-3">2301</a> however, this commenter argued that such benefits would be minimal because they do not help to identify misconduct and/or recognize patterns of market manipulation in real-time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-4" NAME="fr_pz70-4">2302</a> The commenter mentioned that the CAT Plan would not effectively and efficiently deter violative behavior, thereby only resulting in marginal improvements to enforcement.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-5" NAME="fr_pz70-5">2303</a> The Commission also received a comment stating that the Plan is overly-focused on best execution, which requires parsing bid and offer information on a minute scale, and that this may overwhelm the system and thereby prevent the capture of relevant information and frustrate the generally stated goals of CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-6" NAME="fr_pz70-6">2304</a> One commenter also stated that the Commission is overly optimistic with respect to the benefits of CAT to enforcement activity, mainly due to the Plan lacking an analytical framework embedded in its design.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ALS3" NAME="fr_ALS3">2305</a> The Participants did not specifically provide a response to the commenters&#8217; concerns.</p>
          <p id="a90c5346-d107-4588-be9d-4c8ad21dbf2c">The Commission considered these comments and believes that they do not warrant changes to the Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusions of the benefits that the Plan would provide to enforcement investigations. First, while the Commission acknowledges that CAT Data will not assist the Commission in recognizing patterns of market manipulation in real-time, the Commission nonetheless believes that the benefits of CAT Data to performing enforcement activities relative to the Baseline are significant. For instance, Customer Identifying Information in CAT Data would be particularly helpful in identifying a single market participant across the market, which would be useful in identifying insider trading, manipulation and other potentially violative activity that depends on the identity of market participants. Second, in light of the comment on best execution, the Commission believes that while the Plan will facilitate enforcement of best execution, including on <a href="https://gov.ecfr.io/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=baae5e3ff19d674418fbd7489535560e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1611&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 611</a>, this will not prevent the Plan from improving regulators&#8217; ability to investigate other types of violations, including market manipulation and insider trading. Furthermore, by parsing information on a granular scale, the Commission believes that the CAT Plan would increase the proportion of events that can be sequenced, yielding benefits in enforcement investigations. Third, regarding the commenter who stated that the Commission&#8217;s assessment of the effects to enforcement investigations are optimistic because the Plan lacks an analysis framework, the Commission disagrees with this commenter for similar reasons to those stated above.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-3" NAME="fr_pz71-3">2306</a></p>
          <p id="39e37e03-75f4-42b3-a9c2-221761e01c04">While the Commission is not altering its analysis of the benefits in response to the comments it received, the Commission is updating its analysis to recognize modifications to the Plan. Requiring CAT Reporters to report LEIs for Customers and Industry Members in certain circumstances<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-4" NAME="fr_pz71-4">2307</a> should result in a greater ability for regulators to identify traders for the purposes of enforcement activity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-5" NAME="fr_pz71-5">2308</a> This potentially improved data completeness could result in greater benefits to enforcement than stated in the Notice. Benefits to data completeness could also be potentially diminished by Plan modifications that remove the open-close indicator for equities and Options Market Makers. Such information would have been useful in detecting certain market manipulations and violations of rules such as Rule 105, short sale marking rules, and Rule 204 in equities and in identifying whether options market makers engage in aggressive risk-taking trading. The Commission now notes that due to the elimination of the requirement to report an open/close indicator for equities and Options Market Makers as part of CAT, these benefits will no longer be realized. However, the Commission is approving the Plan with this modification for the reasons discussed in Section IV.D.4.c, above. With regards to modifications to the timestamps on Allocation Reports, the Commission now understands that allocations are conducted after a trade and that the allocation time can aid regulators in ways that do not require millisecond-level timestamps. Therefore, modifications to the Plan that now require second-level timestamps would not result in a significant loss of benefits to the Commission. In spite of these modifications to the Plan, the Commission nonetheless believes that the efficiency and efficacy of enforcement investigations will be improved to a greater degree than anticipated in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="e94faba0-92fb-425c-ad33-43425ad5351a">(4) Tips and Complaints</p>
          <p id="24a18d18-1efe-48f0-8072-adebfd83329d">In the Notice, the Commission explained why it believed that the CAT NMS Plan, would improve the process for evaluating tips and complaints by allowing regulators to more effectively triage tips and complaints, which could focus resources on behavior that is most likely to be violative.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz72-5" NAME="fr_pz72-5">2309</a> Specifically, the availability of CAT Data would drastically increase the detail of data available to regulators for the purposes of tip assessment. This would assist the SROs and Commission in identifying which tips and complaints are credible, would help ensure that regulators open investigations or examinations on credible tips and complaints, and would limit regulatory resources spent on unreliable tips and complaints.</p>
          <p id="e601b24a-471f-486f-9ad6-15ce678c969d">The Commission did not receive any comments regarding the benefits that would accrue to investors with regards to how regulators respond to tips and complaints. However, changes to the Plan affect the Commission&#8217;s analysis from the Notice; namely, requiring LEI reporting; enhanced clock synchronization requirements for exchanges; less granular timestamps for allocation reports; and removing the open/close indicator for equities and for Options Market Makers. As discussed above in <a href="#a63ae616-c84f-4b50-9d4c-0a4d7fd0c3cd">Sections V.E.2.c.(2) and (3)</a>, these changes could affect risk based examinations and enforcement investigations, and could thereby affect the ability of regulators to effectively triage tips and complaints. In light of these modifications to the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission continues to believe that benefits would accrue to regulators allowing them to more effectively triage tips and complaints by focusing resources on behavior that is most likely to be violative, thereby resulting in benefits that would also accrue to investors and market participants.</p>

          <p id="e1f98362-9737-4fbe-9870-5ba94d0f9eef">In the Notice, the Commission noted that there are a number of provisions of the CAT NMS Plan that provide for features that are uniquely applicable to a consolidated audit trail or otherwise lack a direct analog in existing data systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A_PS" NAME="fr_A_PS">2310</a> Therefore, rather than analyze the benefits of these provisions as compared to existing NMS Plans or data systems, the Commission analyzed these provisions in comparison to a CAT NMS Plan without these features. The Commission preliminarily believed that these provisions of the CAT NMS Plan would increase the likelihood that the potential benefits of the CAT NMS Plan described above would be realized.</p>
          <p id="de63d305-aab5-43b3-ba31-99118e76ee22">As discussed below, the Commission has revised its analysis in response to comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and the Commission&#8217;s modifications to the Plan.</p>
          <p id="22bb81cc-eb10-4c60-9714-39fdcdb368b7">a. Future Upgrades</p>
          <p id="276e8c4d-3fb0-4b20-9f5d-0cc9b5efecdf">In the Notice, the Commission discussed several Plan provisions that seek to ensure that the CAT Data would continually be updated to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-6" NAME="fr_pz74-6">2311</a> For example, the Plan would require that the CCO review the completeness of CAT Data periodically,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-7" NAME="fr_pz74-7">2312</a> that the Central Repository be scalable to efficiently adjust for new requirements and changes in regulations,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-8" NAME="fr_pz74-8">2313</a> and that Participants provide the Commission with a document outlining how the Participants could incorporate information on select additional products and related Reportable Events.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-9" NAME="fr_pz74-9">2314</a> The Commission preliminarily believed these provisions would allow the CAT to be updated if and when the applicable technologies and regulations change.</p>
          <p id="0bd0f232-fb24-4da3-895e-42c6094350c8">The Commission noted that these provisions are designed to ensure that the Participants consider enhancing and expanding CAT Data shortly after initial implementation of the CAT NMS Plan and that the Participants consider improvements regularly continuing forward. The Commission preliminarily expected that, in addition to these provisions, the CCO review would further facilitate proactive expansion of CAT to account for regulatory changes or changes in how the market operates, or in response to a regulatory need for access to new order events or new information about particular order events. To the extent that the Participants determine that an expansion is necessary and it is approved by the Commission, the Plan&#8217;s scalability provision promotes the efficient implementation of that expansion such that it could be completed at lower cost and/or in a timely manner.</p>
          <p id="fc24b243-2361-4f9a-b039-010cd6e39b90">Taken together, the Commission believed that these provisions could also provide a means for the Commission to ensure that improvements to CAT functionality are considered so as to preserve its existing benefits, or that the expansion of CAT functionality is undertaken in order to create new benefits. The Commission recognized some uncertainty with respect to how effectively these provisions would operate to ensure that improvements to CAT functionality are considered in a way that would maximize the benefits of the Plan, but noted that the Commission does retain the ability to modify the Plan, if such a step becomes necessary to ensure that future upgrades are undertaken as necessary.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAENd" NAME="fr_pAENd">2315</a> Moreover, the focus on scalability, adaptability, and timely maintenance and upgrades promotes a system that could be readily adapted over time. The Commission preliminarily believed that the provisions outlined above would allow the CAT Data to be continually updated to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments.</p>
          <p id="8e2f4bea-4f7b-487d-94e0-9ed6582228e2">The Commission received one comment disagreeing that future upgrades would increase the likelihood that potential future benefits would be realized. The commenter stated that the provisions about future upgrades are infrastructure related, rather than quality improvements in the sense of timely insights to regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-3" NAME="fr_pz76-3">2316</a> Another commenter stated that the proposal for the CCO to be an officer of the CAT LLC as well as an employee of the Plan Processor creates a conflict of interest that would undermine the ability of this officer to carry out his or her responsibilities effectively under the Plan because he or she would owe a fiduciary duty to the Plan Processor rather than the CAT LLC. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-4" NAME="fr_pz76-4">2317</a> The Commission notes that the Plan accords the CCO certain responsibilities related to future upgrades; for example, as noted above, the CCO is responsible for reviewing the completeness of CAT Data periodically and providing the SEC with a document outlining how the Participants could incorporate information on select additional products and related Reportable Events.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-5" NAME="fr_pz76-5">2318</a></p>
          <p id="3575e149-4624-4078-92d3-9f4f9fcdf303">In response to that comment, the Participants recommended a change to the Plan that would require that the CCO have fiduciary duties to the CAT LLC in the same manner and extent as an officer of a Delaware corporation, and that, to the extent those duties conflict with duties the CCO has to the Plan Processor, the duties to the CAT LLC should control.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aex_" NAME="fr_Aex_">2319</a> As discussed in more detail in the Discussion Section, the Commission agrees with this suggestion and has modified the Plan to incorporate this change.</p>
          <p id="f93ac59e-a573-4d11-bc03-af9db9a75dff">The Commission has considered the comments received, the Participants&#8217; response, and the modifications the Commission has made to the Plan. The Commission disagrees with the commenter that stated that the future upgrades would not help to provide &#8220;timely insights to regulators&#8221; because the provisions are &#8220;infrastructure related.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz77-3" NAME="fr_pz77-3">2320</a> As discussed above, the upgrades should improve the completeness of the CAT Data by potentially allowing for its expansion to include information on select additional products and related Reportable Events, and access to more complete data should improve regulatory activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz77-4" NAME="fr_pz77-4">2321</a> Additionally, the required scalability of the Central Repository infrastructure and the mechanism to accept suggested changes from the Advisory Committee and regulators will permit the CAT to meet the needs of the regulators&#8212;such as enhancements benefiting their oversight of the markets&#8212;and be modifiable and adaptable to future technology changes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz77-5" NAME="fr_pz77-5">2322</a></p>
          <p id="1d5a2c6e-f060-4e4e-a21f-8802895383d1">In response to the comment noting that the proposal for the CCO to be an officer of the CAT LLC as well as an employee of the Plan Processor creates a conflict of interest,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AQsV7" NAME="fr_AQsV7">2323</a> the Commission notes that the potential for a conflict of interest would create additional uncertainty as to whether the provisions of the Plan requiring the CCO to review the completeness of CAT Data periodically and to provide the Commission with a document outlining how the Participants could incorporate information on select additional products and related Reportable Events will be carried out in a way that will maximize the benefits of the Plan. However, the modification to the Plan requiring the CCO to have fiduciary duties to the CAT LLC in the same manner and extent as an officer of a Delaware corporation should reduce that uncertainty. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that those provisions will allow the CAT to be updated efficiently if and when the applicable technologies and regulations change.</p>
          <p id="c31257f5-62a8-45b8-9bde-28b163fb299c">Furthermore, the Plan has been modified to require an annual evaluation of potential technological upgrades based upon a review of technological advancements over the preceding year, drawing on Participants&#8217; technology expertise, whether internal or external.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz78-7" NAME="fr_pz78-7">2324</a> The Plan has also been modified to require an annual assessment of whether any data elements should be added, deleted or changed to the CAT Data. Because these amendments result in more frequent evaluations (compared to biannually), and require the evaluations to review technological advancements as well as the usefulness of the data elements in CAT, these amendments should further allow the Participants to consider the appropriate time to make technological upgrades and decisions regarding the inclusion, deletion or modification of data elements.</p>
          <p id="acad87b5-d2ed-49df-8fd7-ea76b58ccace">In summary, the Commission continues to believe that the Plan provides a means for the Commission to ensure that improvements to CAT functionality are considered so as to preserve its existing benefits, or that the expansion of CAT functionality is undertaken in order to create new benefits.</p>
          <p id="4784765f-cb50-4856-87ba-44cc8e0f580f">b. Promotion of Accuracy</p>
          <p id="1a03a11a-0768-4dfd-8e57-8d595894227a">In the Notice, the Commission discussed specific Plan provisions designed to generally promote the accuracy of information contained in the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz78-8" NAME="fr_pz78-8">2325</a> The CCO is required, among other responsibilities, to perform reviews related to the accuracy of information submitted to the Central Repository and report to the Operating Committee with regard thereto,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz79-4" NAME="fr_pz79-4">2326</a> and there is a special Compliance Subcommittee of the Operating Committee, which is established to aid the CCO with regard to, among other things, issues involving the accuracy of information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz79-5" NAME="fr_pz79-5">2327</a> The Plan also contains certain other provisions intended to monitor and address Error Rates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz79-6" NAME="fr_pz79-6">2328</a></p>
          <p id="efd18501-335e-43cc-b13d-d439e249fbf7">The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the provisions were reasonably designed to improve the overall accuracy of CAT Data relative to the exclusion of such provisions. It noted, however, that certain procedures outlined in the Plan might not incentivize all firms to further improve the quality of the data they report. Specifically, because the Plan only discusses penalties or fines for CAT Reporters with excessive Error Rates, the Commission explained that it is not clear what incentive, if any, would be provided to firms with median Error Rates to improve their regulatory data reporting processes, and that this lack of incentive could collectively limit industry&#8217;s incentives to reduce Error Rates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A716" NAME="fr_A716">2329</a></p>
          <p id="9f9644e6-c6d4-4102-b4f8-f11c66efeb0f">In addition, the Commission noted that the Plan includes provisions requiring the establishment of a symbology database that will also foster accuracy. The Commission noted that Participants and their Industry Members will each be required to maintain a five-year running log documenting the time of each clock synchronization performed and the result of such synchronization, and that these requirements should provide a clearer foundation for evaluating the standards set in the Plan upon which future improvements could be considered.</p>
          <p id="e3203952-cf56-491f-8c1a-9daeb4a8ef23">The Commission received several comments regarding the promotion of accuracy in the Plan. One comment letter stated that there are insufficient incentives provided by the Plan for CAT Reporters to reduce Error Rates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-2" NAME="fr_pz80-2">2330</a> The commenter did not provide any additional information as to why the existing incentives are insufficient or any specific suggestions to improve the incentives. Another commenter recommended a &#8220;positive reinforcement&#8221; approach to incentivize the reduction of Error Rates, where firms would be exempted from duplicative reporting systems if their Error Rate for &#8220;comparable&#8221; data in CAT reaches a certain threshold.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-3" NAME="fr_pz80-3">2331</a> In addition, the commenter suggested that customer information fields should be categorized based on the degree of their importance for market surveillance and market reconstruction purposes, so that CAT Reporters can focus on ensuring accuracy of the fields most important for market surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-4" NAME="fr_pz80-4">2332</a> That commenter seemed to agree that an annual review of error rates would promote accuracy, stating that an annual review is &#8220;reasonable.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-5" NAME="fr_pz80-5">2333</a> The same commenter also noted that detailed error reporting statistics for CAT Reporters will assist in minimizing the error rate over time.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_An-qa" NAME="fr_An-qa">2334</a> Another commenter stated their belief that CAT Reporters should have an opportunity to reduce their error rate prior to onboarding on CAT, and furthermore, should receive a grace period before error correction rates are disseminated to regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz81-2" NAME="fr_pz81-2">2335</a> The commenter stated that such provisions, &#8220;would provide them [CAT Reporters] with a window to better understand the data being returned by the CAT, and how it is evaluating data submissions.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz81-3" NAME="fr_pz81-3">2336</a> An additional commenter stated that error rate monitoring is an effective way of ensuring firms put in place pre-validation checks, and that such checks can be an effective method of protecting the integrity and accuracy of the data being reported.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz81-4" NAME="fr_pz81-4">2337</a> The Commission received three comment letters that appeared to support the idea that the annual review of clock synchronization and timestamp standards would promote accuracy.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz81-5" NAME="fr_pz81-5">2338</a> One commenter noted that the annual review would permit a consideration of &#8220;the current state and cost of clock synch technology, and what the current industry practices are regarding adoption of these technologies,&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz81-6" NAME="fr_pz81-6">2339</a> and a second generally agreed with that observation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz81-7" NAME="fr_pz81-7">2340</a> A third supported regular review to assess whether the standard might be introducing &#8220;noise and/or overly distorted signals.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_APmn" NAME="fr_APmn">2341</a> In their response, the Participants stated that with respect to data accuracy, the Participants have included provisions in the Plan to take into account minor and major inconsistencies in customer information. In particular, the Participants noted that Appendix D explains that &#8220;[t]he Plan Processor must design and implement procedures and mechanisms to handle both minor and material inconsistencies in customer information.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-4" NAME="fr_pz82-4">2342</a> They also noted that material inconsistencies must be communicated to the submitting CAT Reporter(s) and resolved within the established error correction timeframe.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-5" NAME="fr_pz82-5">2343</a> The Participants stated that the Central Repository also must have an audit trail showing the resolution of all errors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-6" NAME="fr_pz82-6">2344</a> Finally, the Participants noted that they intend to monitor errors in the customer information fields and will consider, as appropriate, whether to prioritize the correction of certain data fields over others.</p>
          <p id="6ef415a4-6a95-4074-b88e-0d1b214fb42d">Another commenter suggested that a CAT Reporter&#8217;s performance of pre-validation checks prior to submitting data to the CAT can be an effective way to preserve data integrity and accuracy.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-7" NAME="fr_pz82-7">2345</a> In their response, the Participants noted that, in recognition of their potential value in ensuring accurate data submissions, they have discussed with the Bidders various tools that will be made available to CAT Reporters to assist with their data submission, including pre-validation checks.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-8" NAME="fr_pz82-8">2346</a></p>
          <p id="f14f1bbc-eb96-496b-aa85-db3e381072aa">Finally, as discussed in more detail above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-9" NAME="fr_pz82-9">2347</a> another commenter stated that the proposal for the CCO to be an officer of the CAT LLC as well as an employee of the Plan Processor creates a conflict of interest.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ANGnc" NAME="fr_ANGnc">2348</a> The Commission notes that the Plan accords the CCO certain responsibilities related to the promotion of accuracy; for example, as noted above, the CCO is responsible for reviews related to the accuracy of information submitted to the Central Repository and reporting to the Operating Committee with regard thereto. In response to that comment, the Participants proposed a change to the Plan which would require that the CCO have fiduciary duties to the CAT LLC in the same manner and extent as an officer of a Delaware corporation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-3" NAME="fr_pz83-3">2349</a> As discussed in more detail in the Discussion Section, the Commission agrees with this suggestion and has modified the Plan to incorporate this change.</p>
          <p id="c255e8e7-4c66-4709-ae34-69fc37c7c5f4">The Commission has considered the comments and the Participants&#8217; response and is revising its economic analysis as indicated below. In response to the commenter that suggested the prioritization of customer information fields, the Commission notes that it is amending the Plan to require the SROs to submit an assessment of errors in the customer information fields and whether to prioritize the correction of certain data fields over others, within 36 months of Plan Approval.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-4" NAME="fr_pz83-4">2350</a> The Commission agrees with the Participants, however, that the provisions of the Plan requiring the Plan Processor to design and implement procedures and mechanisms to handle both minor and material inconsistencies<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-5" NAME="fr_pz83-5">2351</a> in customer information, requiring material inconsistencies to be resolved within the established error correction timeframe, and requiring the Central Repository to have an audit trail showing the resolution of all errors should help to promote accuracy, as well. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that, the assessment will help to identify any unanticipated issues with the accuracy of the customer information fields and, in addition to the provisions discussed in the Notice and summarized above, should promote the overall accuracy of CAT Data.</p>
          <p id="63d3d40e-b4cd-4535-ab75-7eb06d6bc081">In response to the commenter that suggested CAT Reporters should have an opportunity to reduce their error rate prior to onboarding on CAT, the Commission agrees and believes that such an opportunity exists during the testing periods, particularly as specified in the amended Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz84-4" NAME="fr_pz84-4">2352</a> The Commission is also amending the Plan to require that the CAT testing environment will be made available to Industry Members on a voluntary basis no later than six months prior to when Industry Members are required to report and that more coordinated, structured testing of the CAT System will begin no later than three months prior to when Industry Members are required to report data to CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz84-5" NAME="fr_pz84-5">2353</a> The ability to use a testing environment prior to reporting will promote accuracy of data going forward.</p>
          <p id="64628557-0d71-4681-9ec8-5f444f2a45fb">In response to the comment noting that the proposal for the CCO be an officer of the CAT LLC as well as an employee of the Plan Processor creates a conflict of interest,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz84-6" NAME="fr_pz84-6">2354</a> the Commission notes that the potential for a conflict of interest would create additional uncertainty as to whether the reviews related to the accuracy of information submitted to the Central Repository and reports to the Operating Committee with regard thereto, both of which are delegated to the CCO under the Plan, will be carried out in a way that will maximize the benefits of the Plan. However, the modification to the Plan requiring the CCO to have fiduciary duties to the CAT LLC in the same manner and extent as an officer of a Delaware corporation should reduce that uncertainty.</p>
          <p id="d09eb233-5ad3-4399-a2b9-d5e2dedcf5b4">The Commission also believes that, if they are made available to CAT Reporters, pre-validation checks could promote the accuracy of data in the Central Repository prior to T+5 by reducing errors. However, the Commission notes that the availability of these tools is uncertain.</p>
          <p id="2b17d521-2f65-46cf-aa5e-912fcaf99be2">While the Commission continues to believe that the lack of incentives for firms with median Error Rates to improve their regulatory data reporting processes could collectively limit industry&#8217;s incentives to reduce Error Rates, the Commission agrees with the commenter that suggested that positive reinforcement with respect to error rates may help promote accuracy.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-3" NAME="fr_pz85-3">2355</a> The Commission notes that, as discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AkMC" NAME="fr_AkMC">2356</a> the overall elimination of existing data reporting systems will be conditioned on the availability of quality data in CAT, which may incentivize accurate CAT reporting. While the Commission agrees that allowing CAT Reporters to stop reporting to existing data systems on an individual basis according to their error rates would incentivize CAT Reporters to reduce their error rates, the Commission notes that this approach may not promote the accuracy of CAT Data as a whole, because it could entail a division of market data across multiple data sources that would obligate regulators to merge multiple data sources to conduct their regulatory activities. However, as discussed above, the Commission has amended the Plan to require Participants to consider, in their rule filings to retire duplicative systems, whether individual Industry Members can be exempted from reporting to duplicative systems once their CAT reporting meets specified accuracy standards. This should provide further analysis regarding whether individual reporting exemptions based on meeting data quality standards can incentivize fewer errors while, ensuring that regulators can effectively carry out their obligations using CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz86-3" NAME="fr_pz86-3">2357</a></p>
          <p id="9865cc01-78e2-43b1-948c-8fcf1e68ecdc">The Commission believes that three additional reports and reviews will further promote lower data error rates by focusing attention on the sources of data errors. First, the Plan has also been modified to require an annual evaluation of how the Plan Processor and SROs are monitoring Error Rates and exploring the imposition of Error Rates based on product, data element or other criteria.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz86-4" NAME="fr_pz86-4">2358</a> By increasing the frequency of the evaluation and specifically including this Error Rate information, this analysis will enable the SROs to better understand the factors that generate Error Rates. Second, the Plan has been amended to require an assessment in connection with any Material Systems Changes to the CAT of its potential impact on the maximum Error Rate.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz86-5" NAME="fr_pz86-5">2359</a> This will facilitate understanding of how a particular Material Systems Change would impact Error Rates and whether to temporarily adjust the Error Rates around that Material Systems Change. Third, the Plan has been modified to require the SROs to provide an assessment of the feasibility, benefits and risks and advisability of permitting Industry Members to have bulk access to their reported data. Such an assessment would provide further information on the tradeoffs of bulk extracts, which could allow Industry Members to more efficiently identify and correct data errors.</p>
          <p id="b4956a41-71c2-4f94-baf5-e1aea4bc84ee">The Plan has also been modified to require a report detailing the SROs&#8217; consideration of engaging in coordinated surveillance (e.g., entering into <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117d_62">Rule 17d-2</a> agreements, RSAs or some other approach to coordinate compliance and enforcement oversight of the CAT), within 12 months of Plan Approval.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAyBM" NAME="fr_pAyBM">2360</a> This analysis will promote accuracy by focusing the SROs on ensuring that their members comply with requirements in the Plan.</p>
          <p id="05ba66e6-9f8d-417b-aff6-ee837c21e877">Other amendments could promote accuracy by promoting finer timestamps and shorter clock offset tolerances. The Plan has been modified so that the SROs should apply industry standards related to clock synchronization based on the type of CAT Reporter, type of Industry Member, or type of system, rather than the industry as a whole. In addition, the Plan has been amended to require that the Plan Processor review clock synchronization standards by type of entity and system type six months after effectiveness of the Plan and on an annual basis thereafter. These amendments to the Plan should focus attention on areas where improvements to the clock synchronization and timestamp standards could improve the accuracy of the data at lower cost.</p>
          <p id="ccf35450-e052-4773-9117-f6934bb0c8e5">c. Promotion of Timeliness</p>
          <p id="15457b29-b48e-4236-b694-dfd4fc6ffca6">In addition to the specific timeliness benefits discussed in the foregoing Sections, in the Notice the Commission discussed some Plan provisions that promote performance of the Central Repository, and that therefore could indirectly improve the timeliness of regulator access to or use of the CAT Data. These are found in capacity requirements for the Plan Processor, disaster recovery requirements to ensure the availability of the system, and in supervision and reporting of timeliness issues.</p>
          <p id="faa28de5-2bac-4cab-9bea-3d899c34647b">First, the Plan Processor must measure and monitor Latency within the Central Repository&#8217;s systems, must establish acceptable levels of Latency with the approval of the Operating Committee, and must establish policies and procedures to ensure that data feed delays are communicated to CAT Reporters, the Commission, and Participants&#8217; regulatory Staff.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz88-3" NAME="fr_pz88-3">2361</a> Second, the Plan Processor must develop disaster recovery and business continuity plans to support the continuation of CAT business operations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz88-4" NAME="fr_pz88-4">2362</a> Third, the Chief Compliance Officer of the Plan Processor must conduct regular monitoring of the CAT System for compliance with the Plan, including with respect to the reporting and linkage requirements in Appendix D.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz88-5" NAME="fr_pz88-5">2363</a> Moreover, the Plan Processor must provide the Operating Committee with regular reports on the CAT System&#8217;s operations and maintenance, including its capacity and performance, as set out in Appendix D.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz88-6" NAME="fr_pz88-6">2364</a></p>
          <p id="c3704fc1-3c9d-43ac-b04b-73294d67261c">Furthermore, the Commission discussed that one caveat on the foregoing discussion is that system performance would in part be dependent on a series of SLAs to be negotiated between the Plan Participants and the eventual Plan Processor, including with respect to linkage and order event processing performance, query performance and response times, and system availability.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ABDL" NAME="fr_ABDL">2365</a> As these have not yet actually been negotiated, some of the key timeliness benefits anticipated to accrue from implementation of the Plan could be subject to negotiation.</p>
          <p id="203bbb11-28e8-42a4-a1ad-4511f77b6044">The Commission received several comments on the development of disaster recovery and continuity plans.

As discussed in more detail in the Discussion Section, the Commission agrees with this suggestion and has modified the Plan to incorporate this change. The Commission has considered the comments, the Participants&#8217; response and the modification to the Plan, and continues to believe that the provisions discussed in the Notice and summarized above promote performance of the Central Repository, and therefore could indirectly improve the timeliness of regulator access to or use of the CAT Data.</p>

In response to the comment regarding uninterrupted access to CAT Data in the case of an event that calls for the disaster recovery plan to be activated,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_APfJ" NAME="fr_APfJ">2374</a> the Commission recognizes that regulators may not have uninterrupted access to CAT Data in the event the disaster recovery plan is activated, which may limit the extent to which the disaster recovery plan promotes timeliness relative to a plan that provided for uninterrupted access. However, the Commission notes that the CAT NMS Plan states that the disaster recovery capability will ensure no loss of data and that a secondary processing site must be capable of recovery and restoration of services within 48 hours, but with the goal of next-day recovery.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz91-8" NAME="fr_pz91-8">2375</a> As noted in the Discussion Section, the Commission also expects that, given the importance of the Central Repository, the Plan Processor will strive to reduce the time it will take to restore and recover CAT Data at a backup site. Further, the Commission&#8217;s amendment to the Plan to require an annual review of efforts to reduce the time to restore and recover CAT Data at a back-up site should promote timeliness. Specifically, any enhancements with respect to restoration and backup of data resulting from these reviews will help to further ensure that access to CAT Data after an outage would be timely.</p>

          <p id="b5dc51dd-1636-4069-9292-0f2dfa6aea99">In the Notice, the Commission stated that, in adopting <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, the Commission established certain requirements for the governance of the CAT NMS Plan, stating that those &#8220;requirements are important to the efficient operation and practical evolution of the [CAT] and are responsive to many commenters&#8217; concerns about governance structure, cost allocations, and the inclusion of SRO members as part of the planning process.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-5" NAME="fr_pz92-5">2377</a> Moreover, the Commission did not establish detailed parameters for the governance of the CAT NMS Plan, but rather allowed the SROs to develop specific governance arrangements, subject to a small number of requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-6" NAME="fr_pz92-6">2378</a> For those requirements, the Commission stated that the governance provisions identified in the Adopting Release&#8212;relating to Operating Committee voting and the Advisory Committee&#8212;continue to be important to the efficient operation and practical evolution of the Plan, particularly given that there are a range of possible outcomes with respect to both the costs and benefits of the Plan that depend on future decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-7" NAME="fr_pz92-7">2379</a> Further, the way in which the identified governance provisions have been incorporated into the Plan could help facilitate better decision-making by the relevant parties. This, in turn, means that the Commission could have greater confidence that the benefits resulting from implementation of the Plan would be achieved in an efficient manner and that costs resulting from inefficiencies would be avoided.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-8" NAME="fr_pz92-8">2380</a></p>

          <p id="a6ee2d56-c0f3-4652-a614-0e632fdb4457">Two factors identified by the Commission in the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> Adopting Release as &#8220;important to the efficient operation and practical evolution of the [CAT]&#8221; are voting within the Operating Committee and the role and composition of the Advisory Committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AONc" NAME="fr_AONc">2381</a> Specifically, voting thresholds that result in Operating Committee decision-making that balances the ability of minority members to have alternative views considered with the need to move forward when appropriate to implement needed policies can promote achievement of the Plan&#8217;s benefits in an efficient manner. Similarly, an Advisory Committee that is balanced in terms of membership size and composition, as well as in its ability to present views to the Operating Committee, can result in better performance of its informational role, and thus more efficient achievement of the benefits of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-4" NAME="fr_pz93-4">2382</a></p>
          <p id="f525dc1e-a157-4883-8231-7845058cb661">A. Voting</p>
          <p id="ffefb2bf-076d-432a-9672-7265e9e2b1b1">In adopting <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, the Commission stated that &#8220;an alternate approach&#8221; to voting involving &#8220;the possibility of a governance requirement other than unanimity, or even supermajority approval, for all but the most important decisions&#8221; should be considered, as it &#8220;may be appropriate to avoid a situation where a significant majority of plan sponsors&#8212;or even all but one plan sponsor&#8212;supports an initiative but, due to a unanimous voting requirement, action cannot be undertaken.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-5" NAME="fr_pz93-5">2383</a> The Notice states that the Plan generally eschews a unanimous voting threshold, except for three clearly-defined circumstances&#8212;and that by contrast &#8220;[m]ajority approval of the Operating Committee is sufficient to approve routine matters, arising in the ordinary course of business, while non-routine matters, outside the ordinary course of business, would require a supermajority (two-thirds) vote of the Operating Committee to be approved.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ABQr" NAME="fr_ABQr">2384</a> As the Notice discusses, majority voting avoids the hold-out problem of unanimity, but can result in decisions that bear less concern for the interests of the minority members&#8212;which in turn may depend on the ease with which a majority coalition can be formed, whether those coalitions are fluid or static, and whether in practice decision-making is collegial or contentious.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-3" NAME="fr_pz94-3">2385</a> The Notice also recognizes that &#8220;Participant SROs that are affiliated with one another could vote as a block by designating a single individual to represent them on the Committee,&#8221; thereby permitting those individuals to exercise more influence, but still short of control over voting outcomes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-4" NAME="fr_pz94-4">2386</a> And the Notice states that the Plan&#8217;s supermajority voting requirement for more important matters represents an intermediate ground between majority and unanimous voting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-5" NAME="fr_pz94-5">2387</a></p>
          <p id="3692bd84-c278-4d2c-bae1-0d7977da7bdf">One commenter stated that it supports the EMSAC recommendations regarding changes to NMS Plan governance, which include limiting NMS Plan provisions requiring a unanimous vote and instead requiring two-thirds supermajority voting for substantive changes, plan amendments, and fees, with a simple majority vote for administrative or technical matters and argued that the recommendations should be included in the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-6" NAME="fr_pz94-6">2388</a> The same commenter also supported the recommendation that would involve &#8220;revisit[ing] allocation of voting rights among SROs&#8221; to replace the &#8220;one vote per exchange registration&#8221; model with a model of one vote per exchange family (except if the exchange family has a consolidated market share of 10% or more, then two votes) and recommended that it be applied to the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-7" NAME="fr_pz94-7">2389</a></p>
          <p id="09e4fad5-a09f-471a-8a86-2aaf4f0b162e">With respect to unanimous voting, the Participants&#8217; response noted that the Plan already significantly limits the use of unanimous voting to three well-defined circumstances, and that the Plan differs from other NMS Plans in this regard.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-5" NAME="fr_pz95-5">2390</a> With respect to allocation of voting to exchanges or exchange families, the Participants stated that because each Participant has obligations under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, each Participant should receive a vote.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-6" NAME="fr_pz95-6">2391</a> The Participants also noted that this approach is consistent with other NMS Plans.</p>
          <p id="c0314050-0d1a-483f-9771-e9bd4461ce42">The Commission has analyzed the comments received and discusses them in turn below, focusing on the CAT NMS Plan, and specifically on the question of whether the governance structure as amended in this Notice would decrease Plan uncertainty for purposes of the Commission&#8217;s approval of the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-7" NAME="fr_pz95-7">2392</a></p>
          <p id="eeb8ee97-8449-446f-808b-328e4ff17fb6">With respect to voting thresholds, the Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan already anticipated the need for a voting structure that differs from other NMS Plans in following the Commission&#8217;s recommendation to seek an &#8220;alternative approach.&#8221; The CAT NMS Plan requires unanimous voting only in three specific instances and otherwise relies on supermajority or majority votes,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-8" NAME="fr_pz95-8">2393</a> which the Commission notes is generally consistent with the suggestions made by the commenters. With respect to allocation of votes, the Commission believes that the exchange family approach could potentially give smaller or unaffiliated exchanges a more significant voice in Operating Committee decision-making, but it is already the case under the Plan that no single exchange family or even pair of exchange families can themselves control voting outcomes, even at a majority voting threshold.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz96-4" NAME="fr_pz96-4">2394</a> Thus, the determinants of whether majority voting would result in adequate attention to the rights of minority members continues to turn on the factors set out in the economic analysis accompanying the Notice.</p>

          <p id="efcc49b7-60f1-4a50-8960-ed38a5715d6b">A number of commenters raised concerns about the extent of input from entities other than plan sponsors into the governance of the Plan. Several of these commenters cited what they perceived to be governance shortcomings with other NMS Plans that have a governance structure similar to that of the CAT NMS Plan &#8212; i.e., those that also have an Operating Committee limited to SRO members, and an Advisory Committee for generating input from a broader set of interested parties.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-2" NAME="fr_pz98-2">2403</a> In addition to generalized concerns about Advisory Committees having a lack of &#8220;visibility,&#8221; &#8220;voice,&#8221; or &#8220;authority,&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-19" NAME="fr_pz98-19">2404</a> commenters raised a number of ways in which they believe Advisory Committees&#8217; ability to provide effective input into Operating Committees&#8217; decision-making has been limited: executive sessions of Operating Committees are overused to exclude Advisory Committee participation;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-20" NAME="fr_pz98-20">2405</a> robust information-sharing was not practiced;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-2" NAME="fr_pz99-2">2406</a> and other similar obstacles.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-3" NAME="fr_pz99-3">2407</a>These and other commenters expressed the view that voting representation for certain types of entities<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-4" NAME="fr_pz99-4">2408</a> on the Plan&#8217;s Operating Committee was necessary to promote fully-informed and high-quality decision-making,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-5" NAME="fr_pz99-5">2409</a> to enhance transparency and mitigate plan sponsor conflicts of interest,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-3" NAME="fr_pz100-3">2410</a> or to ensure adequate incentives exist to drive future improvements to the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-4" NAME="fr_pz100-4">2411</a></p>
          <p id="7da675a3-3779-4f5b-ad55-c7c4af0bc065">Some commenters argued for improving the effectiveness of the Advisory Committee&#8212;on its own merits, in addition to changes to the Operating Committee, or as a second-best alternative to Operating Committee changes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-5" NAME="fr_pz100-5">2412</a> Along these lines, several commenters asserted that the membership of the Advisory Committee should be expanded to include more or additional types of entities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-6" NAME="fr_pz100-6">2413</a> Commenters also suggested that the Advisory Committee should be involved in every aspect of CAT decision-making, with procedural protections put in place to ensure a robust role for the Advisory Committee in the operation and administration of the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz101-3" NAME="fr_pz101-3">2414</a> Finally, some commenters called for additional enhanced governance features, such as independent directors, an audit committee, or publicly-released financial and other disclosures.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz101-4" NAME="fr_pz101-4">2415</a></p>
          <p id="9bf08d3d-16d7-4900-b489-7b16207104d4">One commenter objected wholesale to the governance structure of the Plan, asserting that the &#8220;governance of the CAT must not be riddled with conflicts of interest&#8221; and that therefore the CAT should either be controlled entirely by the Commission, or that the CAT governance structure should be radically altered, in order for it to be more consistent with the public interest and the SEC&#8217;s mission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz102-4" NAME="fr_pz102-4">2416</a></p>

          <p id="28d70c70-0de1-4f1a-972a-b4785b30cf9d">In their responses, Participants responded to many of the concerns raised by the commenters. First, the Participants stated that the composition of the Operating Committee is consistent with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, and including non-SROs on the Committee could give rise to conflicts of interest as entities that are the subject of market surveillance would be given a role in determining how such market surveillance would operate.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz103-5" NAME="fr_pz103-5">2419</a> Moreover, the Advisory Committee would provide non-SROs with an &#8220;appropriate and meaningful forum&#8221; in which to make their views known.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz103-6" NAME="fr_pz103-6">2420</a></p>
          <p id="08e41069-ef8e-46de-bd99-19e308406265">With respect to the Advisory Committee, the Participants agreed with certain commenters who had called for additional entities to be added to the membership of the Advisory Committee, and therefore proposed a Plan amendment to add a service bureau representative, along with an additional institutional investor representative (while requiring one of the three institutional investor representatives to represent registered funds).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AuvA" NAME="fr_AuvA">2421</a> However, the Participants disagreed with adding financial economists, as there is already an academic who could be a financial economist; trade groups, as there are already individual members thereof represented; or additional broker-dealers, as there are already several representatives from different segments of the industry &#8212; and adding so many additional people would &#8220;likely hamper, rather than facilitate, discussion.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz104-4" NAME="fr_pz104-4">2422</a> With respect to the appointment of Advisory Committee members, the Participants rejected the suggestion that the broker-dealer members of the Advisory Committee be permitted to make appointments, but determined to amend the Plan to provide the Advisory Committee an opportunity to advise the Operating Committee on candidates before the Operating Committee makes an appointment.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz104-5" NAME="fr_pz104-5">2423</a></p>
          <p id="5b757a29-9ca9-4cb8-8777-94721e05a3b2">With respect to the activities of the Advisory Committee, the Participants stated that the existing structure provided under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> already provides the Advisory Committee with an appropriate, active role in governance, and that no changes are needed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz104-6" NAME="fr_pz104-6">2424</a> Similarly, the Participants did not believe that a change to provisions governing consideration of Material Amendments was necessary to provide the Advisory Committee with a more robust role.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ApKO" NAME="fr_ApKO">2425</a></p>
          <p id="bcf89d81-a543-4141-9343-561decde7150">With respect to the additional procedural protections for the effectiveness of the Advisory Committee, the Participants asserted that, first, with respect to Executive Sessions, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and the Plan strike the right balance, as the Plan Participants need the opportunity to discuss certain matters, including certain regulatory and security issues, without the participation of the industry, and that maintaining flexibility in determining when to meet in Executive Session is important. But Participants nonetheless clarified that they intend to limit Executive Sessions to &#8220;limited purposes requiring confidentiality.&#8221; Second, Participants asserted that similarly the right balance has been struck with respect to the treatment of Advisory Committee requests and recommendations, as the commenters&#8217; proposed procedural protections are formulaic, and could hamper interactions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz105-3" NAME="fr_pz105-3">2426</a> The Participants also affirmed their belief that &#8220;as a matter of good corporate governance, the Operating Committee should take into consideration the Advisory Committee&#8217;s input regarding the CAT.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz105-4" NAME="fr_pz105-4">2427</a></p>
          <p id="1ca6cbfd-9f9f-446c-b1a2-20c15b1460d0">Finally, with respect to the other governance features requested by commenters, the Participants declined to make any changes. With respect to independent directors, according to Participants, the composition of the Operating Committee as set forth in the Plan is consistent with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>, and adding independent directors is unnecessary, given existing independent representation on SRO boards.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz105-5" NAME="fr_pz105-5">2428</a> Moreover, they asserted that an audit committee is unnecessary, because the CAT will operate on a break-even (versus for-profit) basis, the Operating Committee members can act objectively, and the Compliance Subcommittee can aid the CCO in much the same way as an independent audit committee would.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz105-6" NAME="fr_pz105-6">2429</a> Finally, the Participants noted that financial transparency is accomplished through Advisory Committee members&#8217; right to access information about the operation of the CAT and their receipt of minutes from meetings; also, financial information related to the CAT will be disclosed in fee filings with the Commission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz106-4" NAME="fr_pz106-4">2430</a></p>
          <p id="4213718a-3904-4aca-be78-08a4de735519">The Commission has considered the comments it received regarding governance issues but believes that the economic benefits and tradeoffs of the CAT NMS Plan governance structure examined in the Notice continue to apply. The Commission in the Notice stated that the governance provisions of the CAT could &#8220;help promote better decision-making by the relevant parties&#8221; and thereby &#8220;could mitigate concerns about potential uncertainty in the economic effects of the Plan by giving the Commission greater confidence that its expected benefits would be achieved in an efficient manner and that costs resulting from inefficiencies would be avoided.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AjQgS" NAME="fr_AjQgS">2431</a> While commenters have not raised issues that would cause the Commission to fundamentally reconsider that assessment, commenters have called attention to ways in which they believe NMS Plan governance could be improved to increase the likelihood that the benefits of the plan would be achieved in an efficient manner and that costs resulting from inefficiencies would be avoided. These are discussed in turn below, along with the changes the Participants recommended making to the Plan, and which the Commission has made, in response to certain comments. As above, the discussion is specific to the CAT NMS Plan, and specifically, the question of whether the governance structure as amended would decrease Plan uncertainty for purposes of the Commission&#8217;s approval of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
          <p id="b02ff369-a315-4f0d-b960-62a73ab2fc89">The Notice did not expressly address the possibility of adding non-SRO members to the Operating Committee, given that the Commission in the Adopting Release for Rule 613 cited the &#8220;regulatory imperative&#8221; that the operations and decisions regarding the CAT be made by SROs, who have the statutory obligation to oversee the securities markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz107-3" NAME="fr_pz107-3">2432</a> The Commission believes that adding non-SROs to the Operating Committee, as advocated by some commenters, could give rise to the types of tradeoffs that are similar to those the Commission identified in the Notice with respect to expanding or diversifying the Advisory Committee: a larger and more diverse Operating Committee could result in better&#8211;informed Operating Committee decision-making, but it could also decrease the ability of Operating Committee members to coordinate effectively in decision making.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz107-4" NAME="fr_pz107-4">2433</a> In particular, non&#8211;SROs may have significantly different interests than SRO members, given that non&#8211;SROs lack the statutory obligation to oversee the securities markets, and their inclusion could give rise to potential conflicts of interest or recusal issues if the Operating Committee were to discuss regulatory surveillance issues. Thus, the Commission believes that adding non-SRO members to the Operating Committee at this time would increase rather than decrease the uncertainty around achieving the benefits of the Plan.</p>
          <p id="fc0a5507-757b-4c7a-885c-ea1c22efddce">Commenters did not challenge the nature of the tradeoffs that apply to the membership of the Advisory Committee, but rather where the particular balance was struck. A larger, more diverse committee as advocated by some commenters could provide additional views that could lead to better-informed decision-making; however, such a committee could also lack cohesion and have difficulty making decisions in a timely manner, which would impede the efficiency of the decision-making process under the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz108-3" NAME="fr_pz108-3">2434</a> Adding a small number of diverse voices as Participants propose to do in response to comments could enhance the quality of Advisory Committee decision-making by increasing the diversity of views that are represented, but risks decreasing the quality of decision-making by making the Advisory Committee larger and less cohesive. It is difficult to determine where the exact tipping point lies, but the changes the Participants propose making to the Plan we believe would on net increase the quality of Plan decision-making: the value of the additional diverse viewpoints appears likely to justify any additional unwieldiness the two additional members might cause. Along these same lines, the Commission further believes that adding the unique perspectives of a financial economist would also increase the quality of the Advisory Committee discussions without unduly burdening its operations, and the Commission has therefore amended the Plan to add to the Advisory Committee an academic who is a financial economist. However, adding a large number of additional members, or members whose views could be expected to largely coincide with those of existing members, as certain commenters sought, makes it more likely that the marginal benefits of expansion would be outweighed by the increase in coordination difficulties.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz108-4" NAME="fr_pz108-4">2435</a></p>
          <p id="d1c3c7e5-8409-4830-8bb3-8df3ecc92866">With respect to the Advisory Committee membership, one commenter suggested that the appointments be made by the broker-dealer members of the Advisory Committee, rather than by the Operating Committee; Participants asserted that the Operating Committee should have selection responsibility. The question of who to vest with appointment power embodies certain tradeoffs: increasing the independence of the Advisory Committee by vesting appointment power in Advisory Committee members may promote more diverse or robust presentation of views to the Operating Committee. On the other hand, it increases the possibility that the Advisory Committee would operate in a manner adversarial to the Operating Committee, and could diminish the likelihood that the Operating Committee would be open to persuasion following consideration of the Advisory Committee&#8217;s views. Moreover, vesting appointment powers solely in the broker-dealer members of the Advisory Committee, as opposed to all members of the Advisory Committee, could result in Advisory Committee membership that overweighs the views of broker-dealers. As a compromise position, the Participants propose to formalize a role for the Advisory Committee in advising the Operating Committee on membership selections. This is not the only compromise position that could balance the interests of SROs and non-SROs and ensure the representation of a diverse set of views to promote well-informed decision-making &#8212; for example, one commenter&#8217;s alternative would provide slightly more power to the Advisory Committee by vesting nominating authority in the Advisory Committee, while providing a veto right to the Operating Committee through the majority vote it would take to confirm a new member. But the Plan, as amended, would promote better-informed decision-making by ensuring the views of existing Advisory Committee members are considered as part of the selection of new members. This should promote membership in the Advisory Committee that is more independent, rather than intellectually-aligned with either the Operating Committee or Advisory Committee (or some subset thereof), and thereby better-able to bring diverse views to the Operating Committee&#8217;s attention in Plan decision-making.</p>
          <p id="0fd7b9c6-83ec-4b9d-82b9-792d9fb9950d">While, as amended, the Plan would provide a role with respect to Advisory Committee membership selection to the Advisory Committee, the Participants did not propose an additional expansion of the activities of the Advisory Committee, as some commenters had sought. It is not clear that procedural changes such as having the Advisory Committee formally vote on matters that the Operating Committee is voting on, as opposed to a less formal way of providing the Operating Committee with the Advisory Committee&#8217;s views with respect to those votes, would materially improve Plan decision-making and thereby reduce uncertainty that benefits would be achieved.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz110-2" NAME="fr_pz110-2">2436</a> Similarly, the Plan&#8217;s current definition of Material Amendment seems appropriately calibrated to bring the most robust decision-making processes to bear on the matters of the greatest importance. Altering the balance to add more process under <a href="">Section 6.9(c)</a> (i.e., to require affirmative approval by Supermajority Vote (Material Amendments) versus a right of objection vested solely in Participants plus a Majority Vote (non-Material Amendments)) could improve the quality of those decisions by making them better-informed&#8212;i.e., by requiring debate and subjecting them to a Supermajority Vote, versus only triggering debate at the option of Participants<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz110-3" NAME="fr_pz110-3">2437</a>&#8212;but the additional delay imposed on decision-making with respect to less significant matters would likely not justify any marginal gains in decisional quality.</p>
          <p id="70f529cc-8f10-4756-8788-9329537235e5">Similarly, the Notice discussed several of the issues raised by commenters, including that the Advisory Committee members are permitted to attend Operating Committee meetings but are excluded from Executive Sessions; that the Advisory Committee&#8217;s access to information is subject to scope and content determinations made by the Operating Committee; and that there is no mechanism under the Plan to ensure that the Operating Committee does in fact consider the views of the Advisory Committee when engaged in Plan decision-making.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AbKq" NAME="fr_AbKq">2438</a> Changing any of these features as commenters suggested would pose certain economic tradeoffs. Commenters did not assert that the Advisory Committee system as currently constructed is unable to function appropriately, but rather in their experience that it does not &#8212; and therefore that additional protections are needed. Cooperation in good faith under the existing structure of the Plan could ensure that Advisory Committee members have access to the information they need to contribute meaningfully to discussions and that Advisory Committee members&#8217; recommendations are taken seriously; absent good faith cooperation, processes would be needed to promote these outcomes. While additional processes could provide protections, they would also increase inflexibility. Thus, adding formal mechanisms where informal mechanisms would have sufficed would add costs, delay, and lack of adaptability with little or no corresponding benefit.</p>
          <p id="1f0dd193-c034-41fc-9b2f-6e575fff3806">In their response, Participants stated that they &#8220;recognize the benefit and purpose of the Advisory Committee and intend to use the Executive Session for limited purposes requiring confidentiality&#8221; and further that &#8220;as a matter of good corporate governance, the Operating Committee should take into consideration the Advisory Committee&#8217;s input regarding the CAT.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AFLY" NAME="fr_AFLY">2439</a> The Commission agrees, and in light of the Participants&#8217; assurances, believes that the protections sought by some commenters are generally not necessary to achieve the Plan&#8217;s benefits and could be counterproductive at this time.</p>
          <p id="37eebda9-8041-4886-976d-64c3748c91cf">However, the Commission is amending the Plan in two ways that respond, at least in part, to certain of commenters&#8217; concerns. First, the Commission is amending the Plan to require that SEC Staff be able to attend Executive Sessions. In addition to the direct oversight benefits that would accrue from SEC Staff attendance at Executive Sessions, SEC Staff would be able to monitor whether Participants are complying with their stated intent of limiting Executive Sessions to purposes requiring confidentiality. The direct and indirect costs of permitting SEC Staff attendance should be low, but potential indirect costs do exist. For example, it may chill the free exchange of ideas in an executive session if the presence of the Participants&#8217; regulator causes the Participants to engage in a less robust conversation, which could diminish the effectiveness of the Plan&#8217;s governance. Similarly, the additional imposition on Executive Sessions may prompt the Participants to seek alternative, informal methods of communication and debate outside the formal governance mechanisms established by the Plan, which could ultimately disadvantage Advisory Committee members if decisions are made informally, without the benefit of their input.</p>
          <p id="a27f010d-f63d-4517-ad2c-89bcff28e5c0">Second, the Commission is amending the Plan to require that the Advisory Committee members receive the same materials and information as the Operating Committee receives (absent confidentiality concerns with respect to such information). This new procedural protection will put Advisory Committee members on an equal informational footing with the Operating Committee, and should thereby allow the Advisory Committee to produce recommendations that are better-informed. The procedural protection should have low direct costs: it does not require the preparation of new materials but simply the dissemination of information that is already prepared for the Operating Committee. However, there could be indirect costs and tradeoffs. Principally, Operating Committee members who are no longer able to exclude certain materials from dissemination to the Advisory Committee members (e.g., materials that are sensitive in some way but do not fall within the confidentiality exception in the Plan) could choose to withhold such materials entirely, thereby making the Operating Committee&#8217;s deliberations less well-informed, or they could seek to hold sensitive discussions in a less formal or less well-documented venue, which could pose the same problems as discussed above with respect to SEC presence in Executive Sessions.</p>
          <p id="5b8283cd-f96b-4b1f-bfde-7ee53fd464df">With respect to the remaining requested protections for which no Plan amendment is being made, the Commission will be alert to future suggestions that cooperation between the Advisory Committee and the Operating Committee is lacking, and will assess, as appropriate, whether additional procedural protections are needed.</p>
          <p id="5cf042fb-938a-4a54-b7e3-13988aa7811d">With respect to the additional governance features for which some commenters advocated &#8212;an independent board, audit committee, and financial transparency &#8212; the economic analysis in the Notice did not specifically discuss these items. The Commission believes that, on balance, commenters advocating for these issues have not raised concerns that would cause the Commission to alter its economic analysis. Having an independent board or audit committee would add an additional layer of complication to Plan decision-making &#8212; triangulating among the Operating Committee, Advisory Committee, and the independent board, thereby increasing the likelihood of untimely decision-making. There do not appear to be significant offsetting benefits at this time, as alternative mechanisms already exist to advance the purposes that these governance enhancements would seek to serve. If the purpose is that there be an external check on potential conflicts of interest, the Advisory Committee can serve in that role, given its ability to receive documents.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz114-3" NAME="fr_pz114-3">2440</a> Similarly, to the extent that independent board members or an audit committee could serve a monitoring function, such a monitoring function could already be accomplished through the Compliance Subcommittee that the Plan establishes to aid the CCO.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz114-4" NAME="fr_pz114-4">2441</a> Because the functions that the additional governance features would fulfill are already performed, at least in some extent, by existing features of Plan governance, adding them does not appear necessary at this time to ensure that the Plan&#8217;s governance is such that uncertainties under the Plan would be diminished.</p>
          <p id="c1559273-bf3d-478f-9510-49c2268d15a2">With respect to the commenter who advocated a radically different method for Plan governance, where the CAT would be controlled by the Commission to avoid conflicts of interest, the Commission notes that SROs are entrusted with regulatory and oversight responsibilities by the Exchange Act; to the extent their commercial interests create an actual or potential conflict of interest, the Advisory Committee is able to monitor and advise the Operating Committee on Plan decision-making, acting as a counter-weight; and to the extent there are any residual unmitigated conflicts, the Commission has authority to intervene. The Commission believes that the CAT NMS Plan approach to balancing and offsetting the conflicts of interest can achieve the regulatory benefits of the CAT.</p>
          <p id="8b71a629-1375-4215-a13a-25a249a6e78b">At this time, given the analysis above, the Commission believes that the governance structure in the Plan as modified increases the likelihood that the benefits of the Plan will be achieved. The Commission notes that more significant changes to NMS Plan governance structures could potentially produce better overall Plan outcomes, but could also lead to additional coordination problems or have unintended consequences. Thus, while the Commission believes that the reduction in uncertainty relating to the achievement of Plan benefits can at this time best be achieved through the Plan&#8217;s approach to governance, the Commission will continue to assess the governance of NMS Plans generally and the tradeoffs between the quality and efficiency of the decision-making processes of NMS Plans.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz115-4" NAME="fr_pz115-4">2442</a></p>
          <p id="953aacf1-ac96-4822-9bcd-5e3ed9ddd007">Finally, one commenter asserted that the CAT should be administered by a single centralized body from a legal, administrative, supervisory, and enforcement perspective, rather than by nineteen separate SROs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz115-5" NAME="fr_pz115-5">2443</a> According to that commenter, while the Plan &#8220;contains permissive language&#8221; that would allow the SROs to enter into agreements with one another, nothing requires the SROs to enter into <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117d_62">17d-2</a> agreements, Regulatory Services Agreements, or some combination thereof. Thus, SROs could interpret the CAT&#8217;s requirements differently, or apply them to duplicative enforcement, which would be &#8220;inefficient and unworkable for firms that are members of several of the SROs.&#8221; Coordination, by contrast, &#8220;will create efficiencies and avoid regulatory duplication, potential inconsistent interpretations and interpretive guidance, and unnecessary compliance costs.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz116-5" NAME="fr_pz116-5">2444</a> The Participants stated that they recognize the potential efficiencies to be achieved through coordination, and plan to consider a <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117d_62">Rule 17d-2</a> agreement.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AQzm" NAME="fr_AQzm">2445</a> The Commission agrees that coordination of efforts can produce efficiencies, but notes that alternative mechanisms for coordination of efforts, including the Operating Committee, also exist. Requiring delegation of authority to one SRO also would not necessarily lead to a better outcome, if such a one-size-fits-all approach were to inhibit the ability to tailor programs to a particular SRO or its members. However, in light of the potential efficiencies, the Commission believes it important that the Participants consider mechanisms for regulatory cooperation, and has therefore amended the Plan to require a report detailing the Participants&#8217; considerations. Thus, the permissive approach taken in the Plan&#8212;where SROs can execute agreements but are not required to do so, particularly where coupled with the Participants&#8217; assertion that they are exploring whether it would in fact be efficient to enter into those agreements and the Plan&#8217;s requirement that they report on whether they have done so&#8212;still promotes the achievement of the Plan&#8217;s regulatory benefits.</p>
          <p id="ce2f688b-d7ba-437e-998f-75a2213e923a">(3) Conclusion</p>
          <p id="07dede12-a84e-4906-a947-7fc1f8afc43d">In the Notice, the Commission concluded by stating its preliminary belief that the governance provisions discussed therein could help promote better decision-making by the relevant parties and, in turn, could mitigate concerns about potential uncertainty in the economic effects of the Plan by giving the Commission greater confidence that its expected benefits would be achieved in an efficient manner and that costs resulting from inefficiencies would be avoided.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz117-5" NAME="fr_pz117-5">2446</a> For the reasons discussed above, the Commission continues to believe that this is the case after considering the comments on its analysis, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan.</p>

        <p id="4fed166e-77da-4f04-b8b1-8db0f7cba712">In the Notice, the Commission preliminarily estimated current costs related to regulatory data reporting, anticipated costs associated with building and maintaining the Central Repository, and the anticipated costs to report CAT Data to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz117-6" NAME="fr_pz117-6">2447</a> These preliminary estimates were calculated from information provided in the CAT NMS Plan as amended on February 27, 2015 as well as supplemental information. The Commission discussed the Plan&#8217;s estimate that the 20 Participants spend $154.1 million annually on reporting regulatory data and performing surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz117-7" NAME="fr_pz117-7">2448</a> The Notice also reported that the approximately 1,800 broker-dealers anticipated to have CAT reporting responsibilities currently spend $1.6 billion annually on regulatory data reporting. The Commission estimated that the cost of the Plan would be approximately $2.4 billion in initial aggregate implementation costs and $1.7 billion in ongoing annual costs. Furthermore, the Notice discussed that market participants would have duplicative audit trail data reporting responsibilities for a period of up to a maximum of 2.5 years preceding the retirement of potentially duplicative regulatory data reporting schemes. The Commission estimated that duplicative audit trail data reporting could cost broker-dealers $1.6 billion per year or more and could cost the Participants up to $6.9 million per year. The Notice also treated all costs of developing the Plan (estimated at $8.8 million at the time the Plan was filed) as sunk costs, excluding them from costs to industry if the Plan were adopted.</p>
        <p id="44afbcb0-4e89-4861-9447-7e38436c7797">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief, however, that there is significant uncertainty surrounding the actual implementation costs of CAT and the actual ongoing broker-dealer data reporting costs if the Plan were approved. The Commission explained that the methodology and data limitations used to develop these cost estimates could result in imprecise estimates that may significantly differ from actual costs.</p>
        <p id="ef1e8618-8ea6-4d04-8bad-ad2c1958e654">In the Notice, the Commission considered which elements of the CAT NMS Plan are likely to be among the most significant contributors to CAT costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz118-5" NAME="fr_pz118-5">2449</a> The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that significant sources of costs would include the requirement to report customer information, the requirement to report certain information as part of the Material Terms of the Order, the requirement to use listing exchange symbology, and possibly, the inclusion of Allocation Reports.</p>
        <p id="bb912171-03cb-416a-986e-a4d24a8a067e">The Commission also recognized that a number of second-order effects could result from the approval of the Plan. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ADpO" NAME="fr_ADpO">2450</a> These included market-participant actions designed to avoid direct costs of a security breach; changes to CAT Reporter behavior due to increased surveillance; changes in CAT Reporter behavior to switch from one funding tier to another to qualify for lower fees; and changes in broker-dealer routing practices related to fee differentials across Execution Venues. The Commission also recognized that investors and market participants could face significant costs if CAT Data security were breached.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz119-4" NAME="fr_pz119-4">2451</a></p>
        <p id="0a828c01-d8e6-49a8-ab30-7b90d18000f4">The Commission has considered the comments received, the Participants&#8217; response, and the modifications to the Plan, and has updated and revised its analysis of costs accordingly. The Commission&#8217;s updated cost estimates presented below consider a change in the number of Participants, updated cost information for the Central Repository provided by the Participants, and modifications to the Plan that include: a requirement that exchanges synchronize their clocks to within 100 microseconds of NIST<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz119-5" NAME="fr_pz119-5">2452</a>; changes to the Funding Model regarding the manner in which ATSs are assessed Central Repository costs; and updated milestones regarding the retirement of duplicative systems. The updated estimates also recognize that the Participants plan to recover some portion of their Plan development costs from industry.</p>
        <p id="34c79a8b-c06c-4920-8d6f-b6494b6f2be5">The Commission&#8217;s revised cost estimates cover 21 Participants, rather than 19 as were covered by the Participants Study. Consequently, the Commission has increased its estimate of the Participants&#8217; aggregate implementation costs from $41.1 million to $47.7 million, and increased its estimate of the Participants&#8217; ongoing annual costs from $102.4 million to $118.9 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz119-6" NAME="fr_pz119-6">2453</a> Although these changes also increase the Commission&#8217;s estimate of the implementation and ongoing costs of the Plan to industry, the increases do not change the rounded totals presented in the Notice. The Commission now estimates that the cost of the Plan is approximately $2.4 billion in initial aggregate implementation costs, $55 million in system retirement costs, and $1.7 billion in ongoing annual costs.</p>
        <p id="8eb79cf0-055e-45be-bc67-70b24f019e28">The Commission expands on the analysis of the estimated costs above by exploring individual components of the CAT NMS Plan. In general, the CAT NMS Plan does not break down its cost estimates as a function of particular CAT NMS Plan requirements. Therefore, the Commission discusses the costs of particular requirements separately from the aggregate costs and costs by Participant, and qualitatively discusses costs the Commission is unable to estimate. The Commission has revised its analysis of particular requirements from that in the Notice in three ways. First, the Commission now discusses the uncertainty in its analysis of these costs in more detail. Second, in response to information provided by commenters, the Commission now recognizes that some costs, namely costs associated with reporting Allocation Time and Quote Sent Time, were not included in the estimated costs in the Notice. The Commission now includes these costs in the total costs for broker-dealers where estimates are available or otherwise recognizes them as additional to the existing estimates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz120-3" NAME="fr_pz120-3">2454</a> Third, the Commission no longer judges whether quantified costs attributable to specific elements of the Plan represent a significant contribution to total costs. The Commission is cognizant that some of the costs for particular elements may be significant in isolation even if they are not a large proportion of the aggregate costs of the Plan.</p>
        <p id="4632c3e8-83dd-42e6-b498-96e564cd13f0">The Commission continues to believe that direct costs in the event of a CAT security breach could be significant, but that certain provisions of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and the CAT NMS Plan appear reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of a security breach. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the Plan amendments and the Participants&#8217; response provide more details about the required security provisions and more clarity on the applicability of Regulation SCI standards. The Commission believes that these clarifications address some commenters&#8217; concerns by providing more assurances that the security procedures are reasonably designed to prevent security breaches and that customers will be notified in the event of a breach; nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that the costs of a breach could be quite large.</p>
        <p id="3781cdc4-daee-48c1-aef9-d37adb09033f">As discussed further below, the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the second-order effects that could result from the approval of the Plan is largely unchanged from what was published in the Notice. However, the Commission has revised its analysis to reflect that the Plan will change so that ATS volume is not charged first to broker-dealers operating the ATS and then again to FINRA, which would pass through the fee costs to their members (which include ATSs). Further, the Commission recognizes certain second-order effects that it did not address in the Notice.</p>

However, one commenter had general comments on uncertainties in cost estimates and the scope of what was covered by cost estimates presented in the Plan, stating, &#8220;&#8230;the overarching theme throughout the analysis is that these estimates may not be an accurate reflection of actual costs.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz122-3" NAME="fr_pz122-3">2455</a> The commenter further stated, &#8220;the Proposal does not adequately explain what is included in the calculation of &#8220;costs&#8221; of the system.&#8221; The Commission continues to believe that the cost estimates it provided in the Notice were reliable,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz122-4" NAME="fr_pz122-4">2456</a> though it acknowledges that uncertainties related to the scope and magnitude of the estimated costs remain.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz122-5" NAME="fr_pz122-5">2457</a> The Commission further acknowledges that many cost estimates from the Notice reflect market participants&#8217; estimates of total costs of implementing and maintaining CAT reporting; the Commission agrees with the commenter that the Plan lacks a certain amount of detail on the cost of individual elements that contribute to the total costs of the Plan that will be borne by market participants.</p>
          <p id="ad3586d0-2e2a-4094-8824-36a7e388685d">The Commission attempts to address the individual components of the costs separately below in the Further Analysis of Costs Section.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz122-6" NAME="fr_pz122-6">2458</a> The Commission has also updated and revised certain cost estimates in response to comments and modifications in the Plan, and explains each of those changes below. The Commission acknowledges that, in light of the predictive nature of the analysis and limitations in the available data, uncertainties remain. The Commission believes, however, that the estimates are reliable in that the methodology used to create the estimates is representative of the costs industry will actually incur, and that the magnitude of the estimates appears to be reasonable. The Commission also notes that, while a commenter criticized the uncertainty in the estimates provided in the Notice, the commenter did not offer additional data and did not fault the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the information it did have.</p>
          <p id="862a5537-89c9-402e-bd9d-96851cea46c8">a. Costs of Building and Operating the Central Repository</p>
          <p id="2a536dd7-7848-4544-a60d-ed399f08ab1e">In the Notice, the Commission&#8217;s estimates of costs to build and operate the Central Repository relied on information presented in the Plan as amended on February 27, 2015. At the time of the Notice, the Plan&#8217;s estimates of the costs to build the Central Repository were based on Bids that varied in a range as high as $92 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz123-5" NAME="fr_pz123-5">2459</a> The Plan&#8217;s estimates of annual operating costs at that same time were based on Bids that varied in a range up to $135 million. To estimate the one-time total cost to build the Central Repository, the Plan used the Bids of the final six Shortlisted Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz123-6" NAME="fr_pz123-6">2460</a> The eventual magnitude of Central Repository costs is dependent on the Participants&#8217; selection of the Plan Processor, and may ultimately differ from estimates discussed in the Plan if Bids are revised as the bidding process progresses. The Plan as filed also provided information based on the Bids on the total five-year operating costs for the Central Repository because the annual costs to operate and maintain the Central Repository are not independent of the build cost. Across the six Shortlisted Bidders, the total five-year costs to build and maintain CAT, according to the Plan at the time of the Notice, ranged from $159.8 million to $538.7 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz123-7" NAME="fr_pz123-7">2461</a> In the Notice, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that estimating Central Repository costs using estimates from the Bids was reliable because they are the result of a competitive bidding process, although the Commission recognized that the Bids are not legally binding on Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz124-4" NAME="fr_pz124-4">2462</a></p>
          <p id="71c1e649-bfc3-4630-bed2-c52ba4a9f686">As discussed in the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AM0Ci" NAME="fr_AM0Ci">2463</a> the Commission believed that a range of factors will drive the ultimate costs associated with building and operating the Central Repository and who will bear those costs. Furthermore, the Commission was mindful that the cost estimates associated with building and operating the Central Repository were subject to a number of additional uncertainties. First, the Participants had not yet selected a Plan Processor, and the Shortlisted Bidders had submitted a wide range of cost estimates for building and operating the Central Repository. Second, the individual Bids submitted by the Shortlisted Bidders were not yet final, as Participants could allow Bidders to revise their Bids before the final selection of the Plan Processor. Third, neither the Bidders nor the Commission could anticipate the evolution of technology and market activity with complete prescience.</p>
          <p id="dd3ac898-8263-4a8d-b0ed-fb9f3d79ed6d">One commenter provided an alternate estimate for Central Repository ongoing costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AtGQJ" NAME="fr_AtGQJ">2464</a> The commenter stated, &#8220;[w]e estimate the on-going costs for the CAT infrastructure (inclusive of [Business Continuity Plan/Disaster Recovery] costs), to be about $28 million to $36 million annually assuming a low-latency platform running at about 50 millisecond speed.&#8221; The commenter did not provide additional information or analysis to support this estimate, but the Commission believes it is possible it was derived based on comparisons to costs expected from the Volcker Rule because the commenter cited a study of those costs in support of estimates for costs to broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-3" NAME="fr_pz125-3">2465</a> As discussed below,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-4" NAME="fr_pz125-4">2466</a> the requirements of the Plan are significantly different than the requirements of the Volcker Rule, which is primarily focused on restricting certain trading activities and investments of banking entities, rather than the centralization and standardization of regulatory data reporting. The Commission also notes that the estimates provided in the Notice and updated in the Participants&#8217; response are the result of a competitive bidding process specific to CAT and the Commission deems them reliable.</p>
          <p id="bebfada1-e6ea-46e2-8b3e-b544307efed3">The Commission is updating and revising its economic analysis to incorporate updated estimates in the Participants&#8217; Response Letter III, a modification to the Plan to establish the Company as a 501(c)(6) non-profit entity, and a requirement that the Company&#8217;s financials be in compliance with GAAP and audited by an independent public accounting firm.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-5" NAME="fr_pz125-5">2467</a> The Participants&#8217; Response Letter III contains estimates of the costs of building and operating the Central Repository from those discussed in the Notice to reflect the fact the that Participants have narrowed the number of Bidders to the final three and the range of potential cost estimates is therefore narrower as well. Based on this updated information, the Commission now believes that the costs to build the Central Repository range from $37.5 million to $65 million and annual operating costs range from $36.5 million to $55 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-6" NAME="fr_pz125-6">2468</a> The Participants also clarified that costs from Bids do not include additional expenses that might be incurred such as insurance, operating reserves or third-party costs such as accounting and legal expenses.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz125-7" NAME="fr_pz125-7">2469</a> The Commission further acknowledges that these cost estimates for the Central Repository do not include Quote Sent Time reporting by Option Market Makers and the capture of Allocation Time in Allocation Reports.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz126-6" NAME="fr_pz126-6">2470</a> The Commission does not have cost estimates of, and lacks sufficient information to estimate, the costs to the Central Repository of these fields and the Plan does not include this information and commenters did not offer estimates. The Commission does not believe these costs will significantly impact the costs of building or operating the Central Repository because the addition of these fields does not significantly impact the size or scope of the Central Repository. Further, the Commission notes that costs from the Company that will be passed on to Industry Members will be slightly reduced by organizing the Company as a nonprofit entity because reserve funds will not be taxable as they would have been under the Plan as filed. The Commission notes, however, that CAT fees&#8212;the sole revenue source for the Company&#8212;are not expected to exceed the Company&#8217;s expenses, so the Commission believes these savings will be minor.</p>
          <p id="12d2b454-8c26-4838-9045-221b39794596">Overall, the Commission continues to believe that estimating Central Repository costs using estimates from the Bids is reliable and is therefore updating its cost estimates to reflect updates provided in the Participants&#8217; Response Letter III.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AlmS" NAME="fr_AlmS">2471</a></p>

          <p id="bedb6ed5-2a70-4daf-9dc5-e8ba9e5338c4">In the Notice, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that the Plan&#8217;s estimates of costs for Participants to report CAT Data and of surveillance costs were reasonable and explained the reasoning behind this determination.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-3" NAME="fr_pz127-3">2472</a> At the time, the Plan estimated costs for the Participants as an aggregate across all Participants (the five<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-4" NAME="fr_pz127-4">2473</a> single-license Participants and the five Affiliated Participant Groups).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-11" NAME="fr_pz127-11">2474</a> The implementation cost estimate for Participants was $17.9 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-12" NAME="fr_pz127-12">2475</a> Annual ongoing costs were estimated to be $14.7 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz127-13" NAME="fr_pz127-13">2476</a></p>
          <p id="eadb110e-e2cc-4efc-92fd-1007689309ac">In the Notice, the Commission estimated that the Participants that filed the Plan currently spend $6.9 million annually on data reporting, based on estimates the Participants provided in the Plan. The Notice also states that Participants currently spend approximately $154 million per year on data reporting and surveillance activities. The Participants estimate that they would incur $41 million in CAT implementation costs, and $14.7 million in annual ongoing costs to report CAT Data. In addition to data reporting costs, Participants face costs associated with developing and implementing a surveillance system reasonably designed to make use of the information contained in CAT Data as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(f)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Am9L" NAME="fr_Am9L">2477</a> The Notice discussed the Plan&#8217;s estimates of the costs to Participants to implement surveillance programs using data stored in the Central Repository.

          <p id="d95b7110-470c-4a3a-a7d9-b00d60621001">Finally, in the Notice, the Commission assumed that cost estimates presented in the Plan were limited to costs the Participants would incur if the Plan is approved, and that the cost estimates did not include other costs related to development of the Plan that the Participants have incurred previously, or will incur regardless of approval.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-5" NAME="fr_pz128-5">2479</a> The Plan separately reports that Participants have spent $8.8 million in development costs to date.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-6" NAME="fr_pz128-6">2480</a> Because these development costs do not depend on approval of the Plan, the Commission treated them as sunk costs in the Notice and did not include them in the costs to the Participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz128-7" NAME="fr_pz128-7">2481</a></p>
          <p id="5db40cda-0daa-41a4-bb82-0ddfe6058b85">The Commission received several comments regarding the estimates of Participants&#8217; data reporting costs in the Notice. One commenter stated that estimates of current data reporting costs to Participants are &#8220;grossly underestimated,&#8221; but did not provide further detail or alternate estimates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A4Vh" NAME="fr_A4Vh">2482</a> The same commenter stated the implementation cost estimate of $17.9 million for Participants was &#8220;not too far off,&#8221; but felt the Participants&#8217; estimated costs for legal and consulting services and additional employees were not reliable. The Commenter stated that these costs could be far lower with different technological approaches to capturing audit trail data.</p>
          <p id="f8f530ee-faaf-4e4f-a6ed-d3eda5284207">The Commission also received comments on the estimates of surveillance costs the Participants would incur to incorporate the CAT Data into their surveillance. One commenter implied that savings on surveillance were unlikely, and stated that the lack of an analytical framework did not facilitate the identification of suspicious activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-4" NAME="fr_pz129-4">2483</a> The commenter seemed to express doubt that CAT would reduce ad hoc data requests, calling this idea &#8220;hype.&#8221; The commenter further seemed to imply that the comparable magnitude of annual CAT reporting costs and current regulatory data reporting costs raised questions about the reliability of the Commission&#8217;s analysis of costs. A second commenter, however, stated that &#8220;[t]he consolidated nature of the CAT also should allow the SROs to conduct their market surveillance activities more efficiently, allowing for additional cost savings &#8230;.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-5" NAME="fr_pz129-5">2484</a> The commenter did not provide additional detail on what the source of additional efficiencies or cost savings would be. Another commenter noted that uncertainties in the manner in which regulators will access data in the Central Repository create significant cost uncertainties, especially if SROs must use bulk extraction to create copies of CAT Data for analysis within their own infrastructure.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz129-6" NAME="fr_pz129-6">2485</a></p>
          <p id="09bd4d2b-c830-40f8-a22e-e6503bb1cee9">A few commenters questioned the apparent inclusion or exclusion of certain costs related to the fee model and development costs. One commenter noted that the Participant cost estimates do not include the &#8220;per-message toll charge in the CAT funding model.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AzCu" NAME="fr_AzCu">2486</a> The Commission received several comments on the $8.8 million Participants incurred in developing the Plan. One Commenter stated that treating all costs related to the development of the Plan as sunk costs &#8220;&#8230;may sound conservative&#8221;, and is a preferred approach if a broad alternative to the Plan is adopted instead of the Plan as noticed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz130-5" NAME="fr_pz130-5">2487</a></p>
          <p id="71b8688e-d8c9-4efd-8166-fc426f2ab1f5">The Participants restated their intention to recoup implementation costs in Participants&#8217; Response Letter II.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A5yg" NAME="fr_A5yg">2488</a> Furthermore, they cited an expectation of $10.6 million in savings from retiring existing systems. The Participants further stated that these savings would offset costs of implementing CAT.</p>
          <p id="839834fe-e021-4582-87d0-b5b9b12b4a44">The Commission considered the comments, the Participants&#8217; responses, and modifications to the Plan and, as explained below, is updating its analysis of Participants&#8217; CAT costs. These changes acknowledge a change in the number of Participants, the addition of Quote Sent Times for option market maker quotes, requirements to produce additional reports and add more specificity in current reports, as well as producing current reports more frequently, the requirement to conduct an independent audit of expenses for the development of the Plan, annual audit expense for the Company, and a modification to the clock synchronization requirement for exchanges. The Commission is also acknowledging system retirement costs that the Participants will incur when duplicative reporting systems are retired. Further, in response to a comment and the Participants&#8217; response, the Commission is also revising its cost estimates to change how it treats the costs already incurred by Participants to develop the Plan.</p>
          <p id="88609d2d-c2aa-40ac-a3d1-391a7e89ecc3">The Commission has considered the comments it received regarding cost estimates for Participants in the Plan and continues to believe that Participant cost estimates presented in the Plan are reliable. As discussed in the Notice, all 19 SROs<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-3" NAME="fr_pz131-3">2489</a> responded to the Participants Study, and most SROs have experience collecting audit trail data, familiarity with the requirements of CAT, and expertise in their business practices. The commenter that challenged the current data reporting costs provided no reasoning or estimates to indicate that the Participants are unable to reasonably estimate their own costs. Regarding the comment that its estimates did not fully incorporate the &#8220;per-message&#8221; fees that Participants will face, the Commission notes that the Plan&#8217;s funding model does not charge Participants for message-traffic. Further, the Commission&#8217;s analysis acknowledged that Central Repository costs will be passed on to both Participants and Industry Members by an unidentified formula, thus it accounted for funding model costs separately in its analysis of total costs of the Plan.</p>
          <p id="305a2f84-9ebb-43fc-92b7-22e00b0d817a">Regarding the comment concerning the inclusion of an analytical framework in surveillance cost estimates in the Plan, the Plan does incorporate an analytical framework.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-4" NAME="fr_pz131-4">2490</a> Therefore, the Commission believes that Participant cost estimates already account for an analytical framework. Regarding the uncertainties in Participant costs related to bulk extraction causing SROs to host their own copies of CAT Data, while the Plan requires a bulk extraction tool, it also requires analytical tools for manipulating and analyzing data within the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz131-5" NAME="fr_pz131-5">2491</a> The Commission believes that the requirement for a method of bulk downloading data does not necessarily imply that multiple copies of CAT Data will be hosted on SRO systems. The Commission acknowledges that if SROs use the bulk download feature to replicate some or all CAT Data on their own systems, their costs are likely to increase because hosting large databases is costly. However, the Commission believes that SROs are likely to consider the cost implications when contemplating replicating large portions of the Central Repository within their IT infrastructure and presumably will only do so when it is efficient for them to do so.</p>
          <p id="0b34fd2e-5ece-4e0f-8a9b-61d3a737654e">The Commission recognizes, however, that the Plan calls for recovery of some or all of the CAT development costs from Industry Members. And, based on the Participants&#8217; response, the Commission now believes that the expectation the Participants will recoup these costs will effectively reduce the SROs&#8217; future costs while increasing future costs of Industry Members. The Commission therefore is adding the development costs for CAT to the implementation costs of broker-dealers, as indicated in the following Section, and subtracting them from Participants&#8217; implementation costs as in Table 3 below. Overall, as detailed in the Aggregate Costs Section below, the Commission also believes the recovery of these costs from Industry Members would constitute a transfer from Industry Members to Participants, but would not affect the total cost of CAT to market participants in aggregate.</p>
          <p id="57037163-793b-4555-b6f3-57dea68cd5f5">The Commission is revising its Participant cost estimates to account for additional requirements that result from modifications made to the Plan by the Commission. These requirements include a number of reports, some produced one time, some produced on an ongoing basis. Each of these requirements is discussed briefly below. In aggregate, the Commission estimates they have a one-time cost of $1.1 million and annual, ongoing costs of $1.1 million.</p>

The Commission is also recognizing that the Participants will recoup $8.8 million in Plan development costs, as discussed above. The Commission estimates that Participants will spend approximately $1.1 million to produce one-time reports required by amendments to the Plan, and $1.1 million annually to produce additional periodic reports required by amendments to the Plan. Furthermore, the Commission is recognizing $343,000 in system retirement costs, as discussed below.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz137-2" NAME="fr_pz137-2">2507</a> The Commission is unable to update cost estimates to account for the modifications to the clock synchronization standards for exchanges, but, as discussed below, the Commission does not believe that the modifications will result in substantial cost increases for exchanges.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AlKo" NAME="fr_AlKo">2508</a> The Commission acknowledges that the addition of quote sent times to option market maker quotes may increase costs to options exchanges. Based on comments received, the Commission believes that Participant cost estimates from the Participants Study are unlikely to include the additional expense Participants will incur capturing and processing the Quote Sent Time field. The Commission lacks information to estimate these costs for Participants because the Plan does not include this information and commenters did not offer estimates. Table 3 reflects the Commission&#8217;s estimates after taking these adjustments into consideration.</p>

          <p id="0b169c5b-8b07-43fd-a36d-2b663dba5d06">(1) Summary of Notice and Comments and Commission&#8217;s Response</p>
          <p id="68fecbfc-9b74-48bc-b311-a4e06caf65b6">In the Notice, the Commission provided an analysis of the compliance cost estimates for broker-dealers that included analyzing whether estimates provided in the Plan and based on a Reporters Study survey were reliable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz138-8" NAME="fr_pz138-8">2509</a> The Commission preliminarily believed that the cost estimates for small broker-dealers were not reliable. The Commission described the details of the analysis supporting that conclusion. The Commission then developed and calibrated a model (&#8220;Outsourcing Cost Model&#8221;) to estimate average current data reporting costs and average Plan compliance costs for broker-dealers that the Commission expects will rely on service bureaus to perform their CAT Data reporting responsibilities (&#8220;Outsourcers&#8221;). For other broker-dealers, the &#8220;Insourcers,&#8221; the Commission continued to rely on the large broker-dealer estimates from the Plan. Using this framework, the Commission estimated approximate one-time implementation costs for broker-dealers of $2.1 billion, and annual ongoing costs of CAT reporting of $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p id="d75bc3ec-9aac-4255-bd23-7cd19010b32f">The Commission received comments on the reliability of its Outsourcing Cost Model and its re-estimation of costs. One commenter stated that the Commission&#8217;s estimates of service bureau charges for a small firm &#8220;sound reasonable.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-3" NAME="fr_pz139-3">2510</a> Another commenter noted that even when Outsourcers rely on their service providers (service bureaus or clearing firms) to accomplish current data reporting, the Outsourcers must expend internal resources as well.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-4" NAME="fr_pz139-4">2511</a> A third commenter stated that broker-dealers that clear for other broker-dealers may face higher implementation costs because they may support more broker-dealers than they did before implementation of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz139-5" NAME="fr_pz139-5">2512</a> This commenter also stated that the Commission has not analyzed the cost implications of the phased implementation of small and large Industry Members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Aq2n" NAME="fr_Aq2n">2513</a> The Commission did not receive comments on its analysis or conclusion that the Reporters Study did not provide reliable cost estimates for small broker-dealers.</p>
          <p id="3885a332-fb82-4ad9-9a85-f07e36a814f8">The Commission also received several comments on uncertainties in broker-dealer cost estimates. Three of these comments related to the selection of the Plan Processor. One commenter stated, &#8220;not knowing who the CAT Processor is introduces a significant amount of uncertainty. . . . We believe the Commission discounts the importance of the choice of Plan Processor as it relates to implementation costs. While the bids to build the Processor may be within a sufficiently narrow range so as to negate those costs, the choice of Processor may have a significant impact on broker-dealer implementation costs.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-3" NAME="fr_pz140-3">2514</a> A commenter stated that the differences in Bids prevented broker-dealers from &#8220;&#8230;provid[ing] more definitive cost estimates and other projections related to CAT implementation.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-4" NAME="fr_pz140-4">2515</a> Other commenters noted that the Plan&#8217;s lack of specific details creates uncertainty around what costs broker-dealers will incur to implement these provisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-5" NAME="fr_pz140-5">2516</a> Other comment letters discussed the general uncertainties that result from not having the technical specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz140-6" NAME="fr_pz140-6">2517</a></p>
          <p id="100e72ee-0ca9-4940-897f-7446756182eb">The Commission has considered these comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan and is updating and revising its cost estimates. As discussed below, the Commission now acknowledges that its estimates exclude some additional costs that would be faced by Outsourcers or new reporters that clear for other broker-dealers, or that provide support for introducing broker-dealers. The Commission further acknowledges that broker-dealer costs presented in its analysis are subject to significant uncertainties and recognizes additional sources of uncertainty. The Commission is also updating its analysis of the costs to recognize the effects of modifications to the requirement to report an open/close indicator and allocation time, and is revising its analysis to indirectly account for the Participants&#8217; development costs. However, the Commission is not revising the structure of its Outsourcing Cost Model, its conclusions regarding the reliability of the Reporters Study, or estimates of the broker-dealers&#8217; current, implementation or ongoing costs.</p>
          <p id="62149fa7-ac19-4a54-98c5-367cd0b8d0ac">With respect to the comment that the Outsourcing Cost Model does not account for internal expenses that support outsourced activities, the Commission notes that its cost estimates explicitly assume that Outsourcers have employee expenses that cover these activities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pApBMe" NAME="fr_pApBMe">2518</a> With respect to the commenters concerned that the Commission&#8217;s estimates do not account for an increase in costs for broker-dealers that clear for other broker-dealers or provide support to introducing broker-dealers, the Commission continues to believe the analysis of broker-dealer implementation costs presented in the Notice is generally reliable, and notes that Reporters Study estimates for large broker-dealers are likely to include these expenses because survey respondents are likely to include broker-dealers that provide these services. The Commission acknowledges, however, that there are some broker-dealers &#8211; such as one of the commenters &#8211; that would be classified as Outsourcers or new reporters for which the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates rely on the Outsourcing Cost Model, and the additional implementation costs that these firms face due to clearing for other broker-dealers or supporting introducing broker-dealers are not captured by the Outsourcing Cost Model. Costs that Outsourcers and new reporters that continue to clear for other broker-dealers will face include, but are likely not limited to, additional costs associated with reporting customer information to the Central Repository and costs associated with receiving customer information from their broker-dealer clients. Outsourcers and new reporters that currently clear for other broker-dealers or support introducing broker-dealers that elect to outsource their clearing or regulatory data reporting will face costs that include, but are not limited to, costs associated with establishing service provider relationships with other broker-dealers; and lost revenues from providing services for other firms if those firms cease providing clearing services or supporting introducing broker-dealers, although the Commission believes that they might be able to establish &#8220;piggyback&#8221; arrangements that allow them to retain their relationships with current customers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz142-3" NAME="fr_pz142-3">2519</a> The Commission, however, cannot estimate the number of broker-dealers that would bear these costs because the Commission lacks data on the number of broker-dealers that clear for other broker-dealers that would be classified as new reporters or Outsourcers. Furthermore, the Commission lacks data to estimate the magnitude of these costs because the Plan does not provide this data and the Commission is unaware of any data available to it that it could use to estimate these costs.</p>
          <p id="7119abcb-0dee-413f-bac6-740ef1c9013f">In response to comment letters that identified sources of uncertainties related to the costs Industry Members will incur, the Commission acknowledges that such costs depend on the Technical Specifications, which will be published no later than one year before Industry Member reporting begins. The Commission now believes that the sources of uncertainty include both how Technical Specifications would vary across Bids, and what costs of CAT are included in cost estimates obtained from market participants and presented in the Plan and included in the Commission&#8217;s analysis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz142-4" NAME="fr_pz142-4">2520</a> However, the Commission notes that final Bids will not be submitted until after the Plan is approved, so the Commission is unable to quantify the degree of variation in broker-dealer implementation costs across Bids.</p>
          <p id="26862649-1ec6-4d14-a9e7-2026f007f85f">The Commission has also revised its analysis of its cost estimates to account for the following things: the clarification that Participants intend to recoup their development costs; modifications to the Plan regarding reporting the open/close indicator for equities and Options Market Makers; costs for Options Market Makers to provide Quote Sent Time; and costs related to providing allocation times on Allocation Reports. The Participants&#8217; response clarified that the Participants intend to recoup some of the more than $8.8 million they have already spent to develop the CAT NMS Plan by collecting fees from broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz143-2" NAME="fr_pz143-2">2521</a> In the Notice, the Commission treated such costs as sunk costs incurred by the Participants and did not include them in its analysis of the Plan, but is now recognizing that these costs will be transferred to broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz143-3" NAME="fr_pz143-3">2522</a> Therefore, the Commission adds the development costs to the costs to broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz143-13" NAME="fr_pz143-13">2523</a> The Commission recognizes that the modification that removes the open/close indicator for equities and Options Market Makers will reduce the implementation and potentially ongoing costs for Industry Members. However, as discussed in the further analysis of costs Section below,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz143-14" NAME="fr_pz143-14">2524</a> the Commission is not certain whether Industry Members included these costs in their cost survey results, and the Commission does not have sufficient information on these costs to remove them from its estimates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz144-3" NAME="fr_pz144-3">2525</a> With regard to Quote Sent Time, the Commission is incorporating estimates discussed in the Notice but not included separately in cost estimates published in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz144-4" NAME="fr_pz144-4">2526</a> The Commission recognizes that the modifications related to including allocation times will reduce costs to Industry Members, but also recognizes that the Commission did not previously account for these costs in estimates of their costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz144-5" NAME="fr_pz144-5">2527</a> Therefore, the Commission is adding the estimated costs of including allocation time as required under the Plan as amended to its cost estimates. The Commission notes that this increase in broker-dealer costs is small relative to the other estimated costs of broker-dealers and therefore does not change the rounded estimates.</p>
          <p id="e374f9c8-de00-4704-b720-616c6ee9f3c3">Therefore, in its final analysis, the Commission estimates approximate one-time implementation costs for broker-dealers of $2.2 billion, and annual ongoing costs of CAT reporting of $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p id="8b313ba1-62eb-430b-b8c0-da15fd8ddabe">(2) Commission&#8217;s Final Analysis</p>
          <p id="68c990d1-533d-402f-9e50-5bc411bd8d88">The discussion that follows provides a synopsis of the Commission&#8217;s final analysis of the compliance costs of broker-dealers. Because the Commission is not revising the structure of its Outsourcing Cost Model or its conclusions regarding the reliability of the Costs to CAT Reporters Study (&#8220;Reporters Study&#8221;)<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz145-7" NAME="fr_pz145-7">2528</a>, the final analysis regarding these below provides a summary of the more detailed discussions in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="a762a9fe-89ca-4abb-902c-fad2c155ee14">A. Estimates in the Plan</p>
          <p id="d7487db1-3e5b-4ed7-ae3d-7f2d9005101c">The Plan, as amended on February 27, 2015, estimates total costs for those broker-dealers expected to report to CAT. In particular, the Plan relies on the Reporters Study. Based on the Reporters Study survey data, the Plan estimates implementation costs of less than $740 million for small firms<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz145-8" NAME="fr_pz145-8">2529</a> and approximately $2.6 billion for large firms, for a total of $3.34 billion in implementation costs for broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz145-15" NAME="fr_pz145-15">2530</a> For annual ongoing costs, the Plan estimates costs of $739 million for small firms and $2.3 billion for large firms, for a total of $3.04 billion in annual ongoing costs for broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AdGf" NAME="fr_AdGf">2531</a></p>
          <p id="6809847d-8250-472e-bd6e-8d4c59643d82">The Commission believes, however, that the cost estimates for small broker-dealers provided in the Plan, which are based upon responses set forth in the Reporters Study, do not provide reliable estimates of smaller CAT Reporter costs for a number of reasons discussed in detail in the Notice and summarized herein.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz146-3" NAME="fr_pz146-3">2532</a> First, some respondents classified as small in the Reporters Study appear to have responded numerically with incorrect units, with such responses resulting in annual estimated cost figures that would be 1,000 times too large. Second, maximum responses in certain categories of costs suggest that some large broker-dealers may have misclassified themselves as small broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz146-4" NAME="fr_pz146-4">2533</a> Third, methods used to remove outliers are likely to have introduced significant biases. Finally, the response rate to the Reporters Study survey was low and is likely to have oversampled small broker-dealers who currently have no OATS reporting obligations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz146-5" NAME="fr_pz146-5">2534</a></p>
          <p id="0eb24dd3-b559-46b6-828f-f079d951db90">Although the Commission concludes that the small broker-dealer cost estimates presented in the Plan are unreliable, the Commission also believes, for reasons discussed in detail in the Notice and summarized herein, that the cost estimates in the Plan for large broker-dealers are reliable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A53J" NAME="fr_A53J">2535</a> The Plan estimates that an OATS-reporting large broker-dealer has current data reporting costs of $8.7 million per year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz147-4" NAME="fr_pz147-4">2536</a> A non-OATS reporting large broker-dealer is currently estimated to spend approximately $1.4 million annually.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz147-5" NAME="fr_pz147-5">2537</a> The Plan estimates that OATS-reporting large broker-dealers would spend approximately $7.2 million to implement CAT Data reporting, and $4.8 million annually for ongoing costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz147-6" NAME="fr_pz147-6">2538</a> For non-OATS reporting large broker-dealers, the Plan estimates $3.9 million in implementation costs and $3.2 million in annual ongoing costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz147-7" NAME="fr_pz147-7">2539</a></p>
          <p id="a7c98606-08ee-4810-b7fd-ba8338a336ab">B. Commission Cost Estimates</p>
          <p id="cdc65d53-96ec-40a8-a083-c4367f92a43c">As discussed in detail in the Notice, the Commission believes that the small firm cost estimates presented in the Reporters Study are unreliable. Therefore, the Commission has re-estimated the costs that broker-dealers likely would incur for CAT implementation and ongoing reporting. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz147-8" NAME="fr_pz147-8">2540</a> The Commission&#8217;s broker-dealer cost estimates incorporate some broker-dealer data from the Plan, but to address issues in the Plan&#8217;s Reporters Study data, the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates also include other data sources described in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz148-2" NAME="fr_pz148-2">2541</a> As with the Plan&#8217;s cost estimates, the Commission&#8217;s re-estimation relies on classifying broker-dealers based on whether they currently report OATS data. However, the re-estimation further classifies broker-dealers based on whether the firm is likely to use a service bureau to report its regulatory data, or, alternatively, whether the firm may choose to self-report its regulatory data. In this re-estimation, the Commission estimates that the 1,800 broker-dealers expected to incur CAT reporting obligations spend approximately $1.6 billion annually to report regulatory data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz148-3" NAME="fr_pz148-3">2542</a> The Commission believes that these broker-dealers will incur approximately $2.2 billion in implementation costs and $1.5 billion in ongoing data reporting costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz148-4" NAME="fr_pz148-4">2543</a> As explained in more detail in the Notice, the Commission believes classifying broker-dealers based on their manner of reporting provides a more accurate estimate of the costs firms will incur because costs differ based on whether the firm insources or outsources reporting responsibilities and insourcing/outsourcing does not necessarily correlate with firm size.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz148-5" NAME="fr_pz148-5">2544</a> The Commission maintains the Plan&#8217;s approach of separating broker-dealer costs of OATS reporting firms from those that have no OATS reporting obligations, recognizing that the group of non-OATS reporting firms are diverse in size and scope of activities. As discussed in detail in the Notice, the Commission believes this is appropriate because firms that do not currently report to OATS will face a different range of costs to implement and maintain CAT reporting because firms that do not report to OATS are likely to have little to no regulatory data infrastructure in place.</p>
          <p id="a0d118a6-babe-4791-836d-554acd0e164c">The Commission&#8217;s framework for estimation of broker-dealers costs, as presented in the Notice and adopted here without alteration, is based on analysis of data provided by FINRA and discussions with broker-dealers and service providers that were detailed in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAurQ" NAME="fr_pAurQ">2545</a> Analysis of data reported by FINRA confirms that there are two primary methods by which broker-dealers accomplish data reporting: insourcing, where the firm reports data to regulators directly; and outsourcing, where a third-party service provider performs the data reporting, usually as part of a service agreement that includes other services. Based on data from FINRA and conversations with market participants discussed in the Notice, the Commission believes that the vast majority of broker-dealers outsource most of their regulatory data reporting functions to third-party firms. A broker-dealer&#8217;s decision to insource/outsource these functions and services can be complex, and different broker-dealers reach different solutions based on their business characteristics. To illustrate, some broker-dealers self-clear trades but outsource regulatory data reporting functions; some broker-dealers have proprietary order handling systems, self-clear trades, and outsource regulatory data reporting functions. Other broker-dealers outsource order-handling, outsource clearing trades, and self-report regulatory data. The most common insource/outsource service configuration, however, for all but the most active-in-the-market broker-dealers is to use one or more service bureaus to handle all of these functions.</p>
          <p id="f7cd28bf-2c6a-4da9-b5ca-ab42f6c7d26f">The framework for the Commission&#8217;s re-estimation, which is described in more detail in the Notice, is as follows.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz150-3" NAME="fr_pz150-3">2546</a> First, the Commission identifies those OATS-reporting firms that insource (&#8220;Insourcers&#8221;) and those that outsource based on an analysis of the number of OATS Reportable Order Events (&#8220;ROEs&#8221;) combined with specific data provided by FINRA on how firms report OATS data. Furthermore, the Commission separately identifies firms that do not report to OATS but are likely to insource based on their expected activity level by identifying Options Market Makers and Electronic Liquidity Providers (&#8220;ELPs&#8221;). Based on that analysis, the Commission estimates that there are 126 OATS-reporting Insourcers and 45 non-OATS reporting Insourcers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz150-4" NAME="fr_pz150-4">2547</a> The Commission&#8217;s re-estimation classifies the remaining 1,629 broker-dealers that the Plan anticipates will have CAT Data reporting obligations as &#8220;Outsourcers,&#8221; based on outsourcing practices observed in data obtained from FINRA.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A8Hx" NAME="fr_A8Hx">2548</a> Next, to determine costs for Insourcers, the Commission relies upon cost estimates for firms classified as &#8220;large&#8221; in the Reporters Study.</p>
          <p id="4fca8196-8d60-4b70-af9e-c8b6b81a2515">For Outsourcers, the Commission uses a model of ongoing outsourcing costs (&#8220;Outsourcing Cost Model&#8221;) to estimate both current regulatory data reporting costs and CAT-related data reporting costs Outsourcers will incur if the CAT NMS Plan is approved. The Commission analyzed data provided by FINRA to establish a count of CAT Reporters likely to outsource their regulatory data reporting functions. The Commission&#8217;s analysis of FINRA reporting data, which is discussed in the Notice, allowed the Commission to examine how broker-dealers&#8217; current outsourcing activities varied with the number of ROEs reported to OATS. Based on this analysis, the Commission believes that the 126 broker-dealers that reported more than 350,000 OATS ROEs between June 15 and July 10, 2015 made the insourcing-outsourcing decision strategically based on the broker-dealer&#8217;s characteristics and preferences, while the remaining OATS reporters were likely to utilize a service bureau to accomplish their regulatory data reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-3" NAME="fr_pz151-3">2549</a></p>
          <p id="b646641b-6bae-468d-aa0d-eb809e390ae8">The Commission estimates ongoing costs for outsourcing firms using a model which, as discussed in more detail in the Notice, was based on data gleaned from discussions with service bureaus and broker-dealers and implementation costs using information learned in conversations with industry.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-4" NAME="fr_pz151-4">2550</a> Based on discussions with market participants, the Commission assumes that the cost function for outsourcing is concave<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz151-5" NAME="fr_pz151-5">2551</a> and applies the same assumption to its final analysis. This type of function is appropriate when costs increase as activity level increases, but the cost per unit of activity (e.g., cost per report) declines as activity increases. For reasons indicated in the Notice, the Commission relies on a schedule of average charges to access liquidity and rebates to provide liquidity from four non-inverted exchanges to estimate the concavity of the exchange pricing function, which the Commission uses to approximate the concavity of the outsourcing cost model.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz152-4" NAME="fr_pz152-4">2552</a> The model&#8217;s output, which the Commission relies on in its final analysis, is an estimate of a broker-dealer&#8217;s cost to outsource data reporting services as part of a bundle of services from a service bureau; for smaller broker-dealers, it is assumed to include provision of an order management system and market connectivity.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz152-5" NAME="fr_pz152-5">2553</a></p>
          <p id="c94a76b2-e830-4b21-a5f3-cbbdb38d0c35">To estimate costs of CAT Data reporting by the service bureaus, the Commission assumes that the pricing function used to estimate current costs will apply for CAT Data reporting, but the costs in relation to the number of ROEs will increase because some events that are excluded from OATS (like proprietary orders originated by a trading desk in the ordinary course of a member&#8217;s market making activities), will be included in CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz152-6" NAME="fr_pz152-6">2554</a></p>
          <p id="68c35071-3f51-4b59-8e3e-47c7709b521c">As discussed in detail in the Notice, application of the model to data provided by FINRA allows the Commission to estimate pre-CAT outsourcing costs for broker-dealers, as well as projected costs under the CAT NMS Plan. The Commission estimates that the 806 broker-dealers that each report fewer than 350,000 OATS ROEs monthly spend an aggregate $100.1 million on annual outsourcing costs. Under the CAT NMS Plan, the Commission estimates that these 806 broker-dealers will spend $100.2 million on annual outsourcing costs. As in the Notice, the Commission recognizes that the magnitude of this increase is quite small, but this is driven by the fact that the vast majority of firms that are assumed to outsource had very low regulatory data reporting levels at the time the estimates were made.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz153-4" NAME="fr_pz153-4">2555</a></p>
          <p id="76f75513-9a45-4113-8536-2de5bb2e88e0">As discussed in the Notice, firms that outsource their regulatory data reporting face additional internal staffing costs associated with this activity. Based on conversations with market participants described in the Notice, the Commission estimates that these firms currently have 0.5 full-time employees devoted to regulatory data reporting activities. The Commission further estimates that these firms will need one full-time employee for one year to implement CAT reporting requirements, and 0.75 full-time employees on an ongoing basis to maintain CAT reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz153-5" NAME="fr_pz153-5">2556</a></p>
          <p id="6f0c8aad-2d4b-4882-b1bd-2ee6fb2da77c">As discussed in the Notice, in addition to broker-dealers that currently report to OATS, the Commission estimates that there are 799 broker-dealers that are excluded from OATS reporting rules due to firm size, or exempt because all of their order flow was routed to a single OATS reporter, such as a clearing broker, that will have CAT reporting responsibilities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz153-6" NAME="fr_pz153-6">2557</a> The Commission assumes that these broker-dealers will have low levels of CAT reporting, similar to those of the typical Outsourcers that currently report to OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz154-3" NAME="fr_pz154-3">2558</a> For these firms, the Commission assumes that under CAT they will incur the average estimated outsourcing cost of firms that report fewer than 350,000 OATS ROEs per month, which is $124,373 annually. Furthermore, because these firms have more limited data reporting requirements than other firms, the Commission assumes these firms have only 0.1 full-time employees dedicated to regulatory data reporting activities. The Commission assumes that these firms will require 2 full-time employees for one year to implement the CAT NMS Plan and 0.75 full-time employees annually to maintain CAT Data reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz154-4" NAME="fr_pz154-4">2559</a></p>
          <p id="01845736-99f2-4657-9b7d-76ff08cf0339">The Commission, however, believes for reasons described in more detail in the Notice that there are three other categories of broker-dealers not reflected in the above detailed cost estimates that do not currently report OATS data but could be CAT Reporters. First, there are at least 14 ELPs that did not carry customer accounts; these firms are not FINRA members and thus have no regular OATS reporting obligations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz154-5" NAME="fr_pz154-5">2560</a> The Commission believes that it is likely that these broker-dealers already have self-reporting capabilities in place because each is a member of an SRO that requires the ability to report to OATS on request. The second group of broker-dealers that are not encompassed by the cost estimates of FINRA member broker-dealers discussed above are those that make markets in options and not equities. Although not required by the CAT NMS Plan to report their option quoting activity to the Central Repository,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-2" NAME="fr_pz155-2">2561</a> these broker-dealers may have customer orders and other activity that will cause them to incur a CAT Data reporting obligation. As explained in the Notice, based on CBOE membership data, the Commission believes that there are 31 options market-making firms that are members of multiple SROs but not FINRA.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-3" NAME="fr_pz155-3">2562</a> The third group comprises 24 broker-dealers that have SRO memberships only with CBOE; the Commission believes that this group is comprised primarily of CBOE floor brokers and, further, believes these firms will incur CAT implementation and ongoing reporting costs similar in magnitude to small equity broker-dealers that currently have no OATS reporting responsibilities because they will face similar tasks to implement and maintain CAT reporting. As explained in the Notice, the Commission assumes the 31 options market-making firms and 14 ELPs are typical of the Reporters Study&#8217;s large, non-OATS reporting firms because this group encompasses large broker-dealers that are not FINRA members, a category that excludes any broker-dealer that carries customer accounts and trades in equities. As in the Notice, for these 45 firms, the Commission relies on cost estimates from the Reporters Study.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz155-4" NAME="fr_pz155-4">2563</a></p>
          <p id="4df4ac0f-e072-426d-ab4d-3cef465d78b6">As discussed in detail in the Notice, pre-CAT Data reporting cost estimates range from $167,000 annually for floor brokers and firms that are exempt from OATS reporting requirements to $8.7 million annually for firms that report more than 350,000 OATS ROEs per month (&#8220;Insourcers&#8221;). Estimates of one-time implementation costs range from $424,000 for OATS reporters that are assumed to outsource (&#8220;OATS Outsourcers&#8221;) to $7.2 million for Insourcers, and ongoing annual costs range from $443,000 annually for firms that are assumed to outsource (OATS Outsourcers, New Outsourcers and Floor Brokers) to $4.8 million for Insourcers.</p>
          <p id="79911458-9706-4595-b5cd-8884f7228b13">Table 4 summarizes the Commission&#8217;s updated estimates of costs to broker-dealers expected from the approval of the CAT NMS Plan. The Commission estimates that broker-dealers spend, in aggregate, approximately $1.6 billion annually on current regulatory data reporting activities. The Commission estimates approximate one-time implementation costs of $2.2 billion, and annual ongoing costs of CAT reporting of $1.5 billion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz156-3" NAME="fr_pz156-3">2564</a> The Commission notes that its estimate of ongoing CAT reporting costs of $1.5 billion is slightly lower than current data reporting costs of $1.6 billion. As explained in the Notice, this differential is driven by expectations of reductions in data reporting costs reported by large OATS-reporting broker-dealers in the Reporters Study survey.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AB3p" NAME="fr_AB3p">2565</a> The Commission estimates that all other categories of broker-dealers will face significant increases in annual data reporting costs. Also, the Commission acknowledges that there are some broker-dealers that would be classified as Outsourcers or new reporters for which the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates rely on the Outsourcing Cost Model, and the additional implementation costs that these firms face due to clearing for other broker-dealers or supporting introducing broker-dealers are not captured by these estimates.</p>

          <p id="9b82d6fe-97bc-4f4a-82aa-932bbe904d1a">The Commission recognizes both that there is uncertainty in these cost estimates and that these cost estimates do not include additional costs that Outsourcers and new reporters that clear for other broker-dealers or support introducing broker-dealers will incur. As explained above, because the Commission&#8217;s Outsourcing Cost Model does not and cannot incorporate these costs, the cost estimates here could underestimate the costs for these firms and, as a result, the total broker-dealer costs. Because Bids are not yet final, the Commission believes that its cost estimates, while reliable in light of available data and information, could differ from actual costs the broker-dealers will incur and that broker-dealers will not know the true magnitude of their costs until they can analyze the Technical Specifications.</p>
          <p id="cb7031ed-e0dc-4ad2-ae9d-e6e800f39da4">d. Costs to Service Bureaus</p>
          <p id="fd79c217-981d-4497-bbbe-d48d9142bcfb">In the Notice, the Commission considered whether to include the implementation and ongoing costs to service bureaus in the aggregate costs of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AHiAl" NAME="fr_AHiAl">2567</a> The Commission preliminarily believed that costs that service bureaus would face to implement CAT should be included as part of the aggregate costs of CAT. While the CAT NMS Plan does not require the use of service bureaus to report CAT Data, the Commission recognized that the most cost effective manner to implement the Plan likely will be for most market participants to continue their current practice of outsourcing their regulatory data reporting to one or more service bureaus. By doing so, the roughly 1,600 broker-dealers predicted to outsource would avoid incurring a significant fraction of CAT implementation costs; instead, service bureaus would incur implementation costs on their behalf. Based on conversations with market participants, the Commission believed that these implementation costs are likely to pass-through to broker-dealers that outsource data reporting, because service contracts between broker-dealers and service bureaus are renegotiated periodically, and approval of the CAT NMS Plan could trigger renegotiation as the bundle of services provided would materially change.</p>
          <p id="b2947939-ac5b-483a-9e59-8bfd750a0e09">The Commission, however, preliminarily believed that the ongoing costs of CAT Data reporting by service bureaus would be duplicative of costs incurred by broker-dealers. The aggregate fees paid by Outsourcers to service bureaus cover the service bureaus&#8217; costs of ongoing data reporting. To include ongoing service bureau costs as a cost of CAT would double-count the costs that broker-dealers incur for CAT Data reporting.</p>
          <p id="53338f41-18e2-4827-804d-ea77033f82de">The CAT NMS Plan estimates aggregate implementation costs of $51.6 million to $118.2 million for service bureaus, depending on the particular data ingestion format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz159-4" NAME="fr_pz159-4">2568</a> Aggregate ongoing annual cost estimates ranged from $38.6 million to $48.7 million. To provide a conservative estimate of aggregate cost estimates for CAT, the Commission included only the maximum implementation cost that vendors would likely face of $118.2 million.</p>
          <p id="568a7381-acb9-4d6b-8210-0f430ac54ac5">One commenter provided additional information regarding service bureau implementation costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AqdEB" NAME="fr_AqdEB">2569</a> The commenter stated that these firms will face $1.3 million in implementation costs related to providing allocation timestamps, and that these costs were not covered by the Vendors Study conducted by the Participants. The Commission believes this estimate is reliable because the commenter is an industry trade group with members that can provide cost estimates to the commenter. Furthermore, the Commission believes it is possible that at the time the Vendor&#8217;s Study was conducted, industry members may not have been aware that allocation timestamps would be required in CAT. Consequently, the Commission is updating its analysis to account for these costs.</p>
          <p id="7c9daa5d-1560-4ccf-a136-2d0eb48f7192">The Commission continues to believe that the only relevant cost for service bureaus to include in the aggregate costs of complying with the Plan is the estimated implementation cost which as adjusted is $119.5 million.</p>

          <p id="b0cc1d9d-540b-4446-a486-f21f8d84c361">In the Notice, the Commission preliminarily estimated that industry would spend $2.4 billion to implement CAT, and $1.7 billion per year in ongoing annual costs. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz161-8" NAME="fr_pz161-8">2570</a> The Commission calculated these numbers as the sum of its estimates for the Central Repository, Participants, broker-dealers, and service bureaus. These compare to Plan estimates of initial aggregate costs to industry of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion and annual ongoing costs of $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz161-9" NAME="fr_pz161-9">2571</a></p>
          <p id="656abe8a-be59-48bd-bcac-0c13676a6c07">In terms of magnitudes of aggregate costs, the Notice discussed that costs to the 126 largest broker-dealers that currently report OATS data would be the largest driver of implementation costs, accounting for 38.3% of CAT implementation costs. Although these broker-dealers would face significant costs in implementing CAT, the Reporters Study survey results suggest that they anticipate lower ongoing reporting costs than they currently incur ($599 million annually in expected aggregate costs versus $1.1 billion annually in current aggregate regulatory data reporting costs). For all other categories of broker-dealers, the Commission estimated ongoing annual costs to be higher than current reporting costs. While broker-dealers are anticipated to bear the greatest share of costs associated with CAT, the Commission discussed the possibility that these costs would be passed on to investors.</p>
          <p id="45bc7a33-5be3-43f0-bc65-97a1754711ca">The Commission received comments on its preliminary estimates of aggregate costs to the industry. One commenter provided alternative cost estimates, citing costs for financial institutions of $2 to 40 million during initial years of CAT, and ongoing costs for CAT infrastructure of $28 to 36 million annually based on an analysis released by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency related to the Volcker Rule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz162-4" NAME="fr_pz162-4">2572</a> Another commenter noted that while aggregate costs are not certain, they will be measured in billions of dollars.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz162-5" NAME="fr_pz162-5">2573</a> The same commenter also noted that the costs of CAT would be passed on to investors.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz162-6" NAME="fr_pz162-6">2574</a></p>
          <p id="edcc8341-b644-4dcb-b40a-fea2c8a57825">The Commission does not believe, however, that these comments require revision of its analysis of the aggregate costs of the Plan.</p>
          <p id="c28cc7b8-28b9-4941-8fd3-9c520131c904">With respect to the comment that suggested that the Commission use Volcker Rule cost estimates to estimate the costs of the Plan, the Commission believes that these estimates are not relevant to the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AMqc4" NAME="fr_AMqc4">2575</a> The requirements of the Plan are significantly different than the requirements of the Volcker Rule, which is primarily focused on restricting certain trading activities and investments of banking entities, rather than the centralization and standardization of regulatory data reporting. Further, while the Commission acknowledges that some market participants will be subject to both the Volcker Rule and CAT, the Commission notes that market participants affected by the Plan are not necessarily comparable to banking entities affected by the Volcker Rule, and thus cost estimates for changes to their business processes would not be applicable to typical CAT reporters, which tend to be smaller institutions. The commenter&#8217;s suggested estimate of $2 million per year for affected market participants that are not large financial institutions does not seem reasonable because the majority of data that must be collected under CAT is already hosted by many of these firms&#8217; service providers, and much of this data is already reported to a regulatory data reporting system (OATS) for a far lower cost than the $2 million estimate.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz163-4" NAME="fr_pz163-4">2576</a></p>
          <p id="b1fedae7-b259-4683-b261-fe825db73043">The Commission agrees with the comment regarding the uncertainty of the cost estimates,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz163-5" NAME="fr_pz163-5">2577</a> and notes that it recognized in the Notice the significant uncertainty surrounding the actual implementation costs of CAT and the actual ongoing broker-dealer data reporting costs if the Plan were approved and is cognizant of the magnitude of the aggregate costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz163-6" NAME="fr_pz163-6">2578</a> The Commission continues to recognize that the methodology and data limitations used to develop these cost estimates could result in imprecise estimates that may significantly differ from actual costs. The Commission continues to believe, however, that it is using its best judgment to assess available information and data to provide analysis and estimates of the costs of the CAT NMS Plan. With regard to the comment that CAT costs will be passed on to investors,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AAV80" NAME="fr_AAV80">2579</a> the Commission acknowledged in the Notice and continues to believe that it is possible that some or most of the costs of CAT will be passed on to investors.</p>
          <p id="09c68e0b-9a0f-4e4d-b2dd-f76ccf929cde">The Commission has, however, updated its aggregate cost estimates to account for the updates to Central Repository, Broker-Dealer, Participant and Service Bureau cost estimates which incorporate updates due to modifications of the Plan. In aggregate, the Commission believes that that industry will spend $2.4 billion to implement CAT, and $1.7 billion per year in ongoing annual costs. Table 5 below shows these new cost estimates and aggregate costs to industry. Some individual estimates have changed from estimates presented in the Notice for a number of reasons. First, the Commission is now recognizing system retirement costs of $55 million. Also, estimates for Participant costs have increased to account for two additional Participants that were not covered by the Participants Study, and to account for the cost of additional reporting required by amendments to the Plan. Finally, estimates for Central Repository implementation and ongoing costs have been updated to reflect the Participants&#8217; current estimates. As Table 5 shows, however, the changes to the cost estimates do not affect the rounded estimates of implementation and ongoing costs presented in the Notice. The Commission recognizes that these cost estimates do not specifically itemize the costs of certain modifications to the Plan or respond to information provided by certain Commenters related to the costs of individual elements of the Plan. The Commission discusses these in detail in <a href="">Section VI.F.3</a> below.</p>

          <p id="9c3b5429-0a39-4987-a0c6-619c6cb603bf">In the Notice, the Commission considered whether to include in its estimates of aggregate compliance costs the costs of system retirement and the costs of duplicative reporting if Participants and broker-dealers need to maintain and report to current systems after commencing reporting to the Central Repository.</p>
          <p id="489d8783-d38d-4de8-abc2-36c37201ce53">The Commission considered the costs for system retirement provided in the Plan, which discussed significant costs ($2.6 billion) for retirement of current regulatory reporting systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz166-3" NAME="fr_pz166-3">2580</a> The Commission did not include those costs in its estimate of the aggregate costs of the Plan, for several reasons. First, the Commission preliminarily believed that the cost estimates provided in the Plan were unlikely to accurately represent the actual costs industry would face in retiring duplicative reporting systems. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz166-4" NAME="fr_pz166-4">2581</a> In particular, for the majority of broker-dealers that outsource, system retirement would affect few in-house systems; these broker-dealers would likely adapt the systems that interface with service bureaus for current regulatory data reporting to interface for CAT Data reporting. Further, for broker-dealers that self-report regulatory data, the Commission could not determine the source of the costs of system retirement that were estimated in the Plan and the magnitude of estimated costs led the Commission to doubt that estimates included only costs of retiring systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AQrSB" NAME="fr_AQrSB">2582</a> Second, the retirement of current regulatory reporting systems was not a requirement of the Plan and the timeline and process for their retirement was uncertain.</p>
          <p id="fa0f688f-0e84-4595-8f23-47a2ac53aad7">While the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates did not recognize explicit system retirement expenses, they also did not explicitly recognize savings from elimination of these systems, though they were recognized qualitatively. In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that this approach was conservative in the sense that system retirement costs would likely be mitigated by incorporation of current reporting infrastructure into CAT reporting infrastructure, while cost savings associated with industry&#8217;s need to maintain fewer regulatory data reporting systems were not explicitly recognized. While the Commission did not include explicit system retirement costs, the Commission did recognize that industry would experience a costly period of duplicative reporting if the CAT NMS Plan were approved, and the Commission stated that it believed it was possible that these costs could be conflated with actual retirement costs estimated in the Plan.</p>
          <p id="4bf464f4-cbc9-4930-9b3e-e081a8037e3c">In the Notice, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that the period of duplicative reporting would likely constitute a major cost to industry for several reasons.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz167-4" NAME="fr_pz167-4">2583</a> These reasons included the length of the duplicative reporting period; constraints on the capacity of industry to implement changes to regulatory reporting infrastructure that might cause market participants to implement changes using less cost-effective resources;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz167-5" NAME="fr_pz167-5">2584</a> and the inability of some market participants to implement duplicative reporting in house, necessitating that they seek service bureau relationships to accomplish their CAT reporting requirements.</p>
          <p id="1b96e4ee-b4ee-474d-9f81-7ada6cfbd6f5">Based on data provided in the Plan, the Commission preliminarily believed that the period of duplicative reporting anticipated by the Participants would likely last for 2 to 2.5 years.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AXt7" NAME="fr_AXt7">2585</a> This time period involved four steps. Step 1, which could take 12 to 18 months, involves the SROs identifying duplicative SRO Rules and systems and Commission rulemaking. Step 2, which would last six months, involves preparations by the SROs to file rule changes, followed by Step 3, lasting three months, for the Commission to approve such rule changes. The last step, Step 4, involves implementation, and the Commission estimated it could last from 90 days to six months, during which time the Plan stated that the Participants could consider when the quality of CAT Data would be sufficient to meet surveillance needs.</p>
          <p id="151e23fa-ee56-4e7c-a158-99d13207e15c">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the current data reporting costs of $1.7 billion per year constituted an estimate of the cost per year to industry of duplicative reporting requirements, as it represents the cost of duplicative reporting to industry if there are no efficiencies that arise when a market participant has to report a subset of already centralized regulatory data to other regulatory data reporting systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz168-3" NAME="fr_pz168-3">2586</a> The Commission did not believe that duplicative reporting costs should be added to the estimated aggregate costs of the CAT NMS Plan. The Commission discussed its belief that that the aggregate costs above represent the total costs of the Plan, and do not account for the differential between these costs and the costs the industry currently incurs for regulatory data reporting and maintenance. During the period of duplicative reporting, industry would incur the aggregate costs of accomplishing CAT reporting described above, plus the costs of current data reporting, which the Commission used as an estimate of duplicative reporting costs. The Commission noted that market participants would incur costs equal to current data reporting costs before system retirement and CAT implementation (because current regulatory data reporting would continue), or as duplicative reporting costs from Plan implementation until system retirement. Consequently, the Commission preliminarily believed these costs should not be considered as costs attributable to approval of the Plan, because market participants would bear these costs whether the Plan is approved or not.</p>

One Commenter disagreed with the Plan&#8217;s estimate that it should cost $2.6 billion to retire redundant systems. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz170-8" NAME="fr_pz170-8">2601</a> Instead, the commenter suggested that a more accurate cost estimate would range from $10,000 to $100,000 per firm. This commenter did not provide an explanation of the how the commenter derived this estimated range and sought more information on the Plan&#8217;s estimate.</p>
          <p id="e41df780-18c2-4bb2-b991-f950eee12d05">The Participants&#8217; Response Letter II discussed comments related to system retirement.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Alb9" NAME="fr_Alb9">2602</a> The Participants noted that Small Industry Members can begin reporting earlier on a voluntary basis, and stated that the Participants will consider a rule change that would accelerate reporting for small Industry Members that are OATS reporters. The Participants also discussed their commitment to eliminating duplicative reporting systems as quickly as possible.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz171-5" NAME="fr_pz171-5">2603</a> They stated that they are incented to eliminate duplicative systems because maintaining the systems is costly.</p>
          <p id="58f73239-197b-42bc-a06a-6711f49c64e8">The Participants also outlined a revised timetable for system retirement that differs from the Plan as filed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz171-6" NAME="fr_pz171-6">2604</a> Under the Participants&#8217; proposal, Step 1 would be completed within 9-12 months after the Plan&#8217;s approval. Step 2, in which Participants file rule changes with the Commission, would end six months after the conclusion of Step 1. The Participants also discussed an exemption for individual CAT reporters from duplicative reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz171-7" NAME="fr_pz171-7">2605</a></p>
          <p id="f25736f7-f04a-46eb-95eb-570f38b80c87">The Commission has considered the comments received, the Participants&#8217; response, and the modifications to the Plan, and is revising its analysis of the costs of duplicative reporting and system retirement as described below. The Commission acknowledges additional uncertainty regarding duplicative reporting due to its revised belief that efficiencies in duplicative reporting are less likely than it believed at the time of the Notice, but continues to believe that duplicative reporting could cost up to $1.7 billion per year. However, as discussed below, the Commission now believes that the period of duplicative reporting is likely to be shorter than was anticipated in the Notice, and that the cost will therefore be reduced. Based on comments received, the Commission has revised its estimate of system retirement costs and now believes the aggregate cost to industry will be approximately $55 million.</p>
          <p id="52eeafc0-49e3-47cb-8bc2-2667df6fe4d3">Consistent with its position in the Notice, the Commission agrees with commenters that duplicative reporting will constitute a major cost to industry, and recognizes that conflicting reporting requirements, varied corrections to the same error across different systems, legal and compliance confusion will all contribute to these costs. Further, the Commission agrees that maintenance of duplicative reporting systems will entail commitment of additional resources such as infrastructure, storage, technical, and staffing resources, as well as costs associated with making changes to redundant systems. However, the Commission notes that modifications to the Plan that minimize changes to potentially duplicative systems during the period of duplicative reporting may mitigate some of these costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz172-4" NAME="fr_pz172-4">2606</a> Regarding the comment that some market participants will see their data reporting costs double during the period of duplicative reporting, the Commission agrees and believes that calculation is reflected in the estimates in the Notice, as its estimate of duplicative reporting costs of $1.7 billion per year is in line with the projected industry costs of ongoing CAT reporting of $1.7 billion per year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz172-5" NAME="fr_pz172-5">2607</a></p>
          <p id="c744e047-9bcd-4b79-bf28-4e8e6c702070">In response to the comment that duplicative reporting does not create efficiencies, the Commission, in the Notice, explained that it expected some cost efficiencies, but expressed uncertainty about those efficiencies. Because of that uncertainty and in light of the comment, the Commission acknowledges that duplicative reporting may not result in efficiencies.</p>
          <p id="7892e0d0-326e-490f-a06d-38aa909d17d4">Based on the changes to the Plan, the Commission now believes that the duplicative reporting period may be shorter than estimated in the Notice. As discussed previously, the Commission has revised the milestones for system retirement, which may decrease the duplicative reporting period compared to the period anticipated at the time of the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-3" NAME="fr_pz173-3">2608</a> Specifically, the gap analyses for major duplicative systems (Step 1) have been substantially completed 3-3.5 years sooner<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-4" NAME="fr_pz173-4">2609</a> than was envisioned in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-5" NAME="fr_pz173-5">2610</a> Furthermore, the Plan as amended now calls for the Participants to file with the Commission within 6 months after Plan approval (Step 2) rule change proposals.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz173-6" NAME="fr_pz173-6">2611</a> Consequently, Step 3 (Commission review of rule modification filings) is expected to commence six months after Plan approval, and, as discussed in the Notice, is expected to take three months to one year. As a result, Step 4 (Participant implementation of rule changes) is the only system retirement step that the Commission expects to extend past when Large Industry Members begin reporting to the Central Repository.</p>
          <p id="446306c0-5ba3-46ad-8fc6-45e76c8d5001">The Commission recognizes that there remains significant uncertainty as to when system retirement will occur, because the actual retirement of such rules and systems will depend upon several factors. In particular, the Commission notes that the retirement of systems will not occur until the CAT Data is of sufficient quality and when the CAT system has been fully implemented for all reporters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-5" NAME="fr_pz174-5">2612</a></p>
          <p id="d971911a-4191-4b1b-bc1d-7ca2e963d0ae">With respect to the quality of the CAT Data, as discussed above, in the Notice the Commission estimated that the period of duplicative reporting was likely to last for 2 to 2.5 years. At the time of the Notice, the Commission&#8217;s estimate suggested that the length of the rule modification steps within the four step process discussed above would primarily determine the length of the overall duplicative reporting period, although it recognized that data quality could delay the retirement of duplicative systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz174-6" NAME="fr_pz174-6">2613</a> The Commission recognized in the Notice that Step 4 (implementation of system retirement plans) required not only the completion of Steps 1 through 3 but also that data quality within the Central Repository had to be adequate for the SRO&#8217;s regulatory needs.</p>
          <p id="1505f881-065b-48a7-b182-f411e7df07cc">The Commission now believes that, while the revision of the system retirement milestones may decrease the length of the duplicative reporting period, this change will also increase the probability that Industry Member data quality might delay system retirement because Industry Members will have less experience reporting CAT Data when the four step process reaches the point where data quality could delay system retirement.</p>
          <p id="3f732e0f-ba5c-42c7-9733-a4f511a26d4f">Additionally, the Commission believes it is possible that, as one commenter suggested,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ArA6" NAME="fr_ArA6">2614</a> the phased implementation of CAT reporting for Small Industry Members could result in up to one year of duplicative reporting expense for Large Industry Members. Specifically, Large Industry Member data quality may reach a level that is sufficient for SRO regulatory needs prior to the commencement of reporting by Small Industry Members to the Central Repository, but retirement of systems might not occur until after those Small Industry Members begin reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-3" NAME="fr_pz175-3">2615</a> Further, it is possible that, as a result of having commenced reporting at a later date, Small Industry Members&#8217; data may not reach an acceptable quality threshold for some period after Large Industry Members&#8217; data has reached an acceptable quality threshold. The phased implementation schedule may therefore limit the extent to which the Plan amendments accelerating the timeframe for initial rule change proposals shorten the duplicative reporting period and thereby reduce the costs of duplicative reporting. Despite this caveat, for reasons explained below, the Commission believes that the amendments could significantly shorten this period and reduce costs.</p>
          <p id="78fd5144-c878-43cc-8906-92c69f887af8">In particular, at least four amendments or other factors might mitigate the impact of phased implementation on duplicative reporting and costs. First, the Commission has amended the Plan to require the Participants&#8217; to include, in their filings to retire systems, specific standards of data accuracy and reliability, including, but not limited to, whether the attainment of a certain Error Rate is reached, <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz175-4" NAME="fr_pz175-4">2616</a> which should incentivize accurate data reporting by both Large and Small Industry Members and reduce the duplicative reporting period. Second, an amendment to the Plan requires Participants&#8217; rule change proposals to consider whether individual Industry Members can be exempted from reporting to duplicative systems once their CAT reporting meets specified accuracy and reliability standards.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz176-2" NAME="fr_pz176-2">2617</a> If the Participants determine to grant such individual exemptions to some Industry Members prior to all Industry Members&#8217; data reaching an acceptable quality threshold, the economic impact of the phased implementation schedule could be less. Third, the Participants have indicated that OATS-reporting Small Industry Members can begin voluntarily reporting at the same time as Large Industry Members, and the Commission encourages the Participants and the Plan Processor to work with these Small Industry Members to enable them to begin reporting to CAT, on a voluntary basis, at the same time that Large Industry Members are required to begin reporting or as soon as practicable. The Commission recognizes, however, that incentives for Small Industry Members to begin reporting voluntarily at an earlier time are limited because accelerating CAT reporting imposes costs on CAT reporters, while the benefits of earlier system retirement accrue primarily to Large Industry Members that face a longer period of duplicative reporting. As a result, the extent to which accelerating commencement of voluntary reporting mitigates the economic impact of the phased implementation schedule may be limited. Therefore, the Commission believes that the amendment to require that the Participants consider whether the availability of Small Industry Member data two years after Plan approval would facilitate more expeditious systems retirement<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AEX1" NAME="fr_AEX1">2618</a> could help to avoid an extension of the duplicative reporting period attributable to the phased implementation schedule.</p>
          <p id="7c8bb6ad-ede0-4e66-b73b-bb128096ef4a">The Commission has also considered the comment that proposed alternative estimates for system retirement costs<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz177-3" NAME="fr_pz177-3">2619</a> and has revised its economic analysis accordingly. Specifically, the Commission believes that this commenter has the expertise to provide reliable estimates because this industry group&#8217;s members can inform it of their costs; furthermore, the Commission believes the estimates this commenter provided seem more reasonable than estimates provided in the Plan because estimates provided in the Plan exceeded the Commission&#8217;s estimate of costs of implementing the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz177-4" NAME="fr_pz177-4">2620</a></p>
          <p id="7c6e104d-e665-496e-a1ee-a478f2a21189">To estimate the aggregate costs of system retirement, the Commission assumes that the $100,000 estimate would be appropriate for Insourcers and the $10,000 estimate would be appropriate for Outsourcers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz177-5" NAME="fr_pz177-5">2621</a> The Commission assumes that for firms that do not currently report to OATS, firms that were considered large for cost estimates (ELPs and Options Market Makers) will have similar system retirement costs to Insourcers because they are more similar in size and scope of operations to Insourcers than Outsourcers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz177-6" NAME="fr_pz177-6">2622</a> The Commission further assumes that non-OATS reporting firms that were considered small for cost estimates (new small firms and options floor brokers) will face similar system retirement costs to Outsourcers because they are more similar in size and scope of operations to Outsourcers than Insourcers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz178-3" NAME="fr_pz178-3">2623</a> With these assumptions, the Commission now estimates that broker-dealer system retirement costs would be $33.4 million, as described in Table 6. The Commission draws its estimates of system retirement costs for Participants and service providers from the Plan, which estimates aggregate costs of $343,000<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz178-4" NAME="fr_pz178-4">2624</a> across all Participants, and $21.3 million across all service providers. The Commission now estimates total industry costs for system retirement will be $55 million.</p>

          <p id="601bba42-2724-4183-8692-7d6e647e698b">In the Notice, the Commission noted that, in general, the CAT NMS Plan does not break down its cost estimates as a function of particular CAT NMS Plan requirements. However, the Commission considered which elements of the CAT NMS Plan were likely to be among the most significant contributors to the estimated CAT costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz179-18" NAME="fr_pz179-18">2625</a> The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that significant sources of costs would include: the requirement to report customer information;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz179-19" NAME="fr_pz179-19">2626</a> the requirement to report certain information as part of the Material Terms of the Order; the requirement to use listing exchange symbology; and the inclusion of Allocation Reports.</p>
          <p id="e9981201-fe4d-420a-9ce3-631403a52ab1">In addition, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that while certain costs could generally be quantifiably estimated, they were unlikely to be significant contributors to the overall costs of the Plan. These factors included: clock synchronization requirements; Plan requirements that include the requirement that Options Market Makers send quote times to the exchanges; the requirement that the Central Repository maintain six years of CAT Data; and the inclusion of OTC Equity Securities in the initial phase of the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan. Furthermore, the Commission also explained that there were other sources of costs, namely costs associated with meeting certain targets such as error rates and management of PII, that could not be quantified by the Commission.</p>
          <p id="5b28fb32-ebf1-41a6-acf4-ad76b335df45">The Commission noted that it believed that its estimates of the implementation costs and ongoing costs to industry included each of the costs discussed, because the provisions encapsulate major parts of the Plan. The Commission explained that it lacked the necessary information to estimate what portion of the costs of the Plan is attributable to some of these aforementioned elements because the Plan does not provide information on the costs attributable to reporting of this information, and the Commission had no other data from which it can independently estimate these costs.</p>
          <p id="a40a1472-033b-40c1-8855-034c2929f169">As discussed more fully below, the Commission has considered the comments it received regarding its analysis of these aforementioned costs, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan, and is updating its analysis in three ways. First, the Commission&#8217;s analysis fully acknowledges the uncertainty in its cost estimates. Second, several comments disagreed with the Commission&#8217;s belief that certain costs were included in the Commission&#8217;s cost estimates. The Commission has analyzed each of these instances below and now believes that some costs, namely costs associated with Allocation Time and Quote Sent Time, were not included in the estimated costs in the Notice. As indicated in the Costs to Broker-Dealers, Costs to Participants, and the Costs of Building and Operating the Central Repository Sections above, the Commission has added these costs to the total costs for broker-dealers where estimates are available or otherwise recognizes them as additional to the existing estimates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz181-4" NAME="fr_pz181-4">2627</a> Third, several commenters disagreed with which costs the Commission noted as significant contributors to CAT costs. In response to comments, the Commission no longer judges whether quantified costs represent a significant contribution to total costs. Instead, it describes only the costs it cannot quantify in terms of whether the Commission believes such costs are a substantial proportion of costs of the CAT NMS Plan, and addresses those individually below. The Commission is cognizant that some of the costs for particular elements may be significant in isolation even if they are not a large proportion of the aggregate costs of the Plan. The following Sections expand on the analysis of the estimated costs above by exploring individual components of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
          <p id="1414b785-d796-4396-9db9-b6d1c9722a28">(1) Customer Information</p>
          <p id="b06427f5-ab2f-43c1-b985-49d69aff2caa">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its belief that the requirement in the CAT NMS Plan to report customer information for each transaction represents a significant source of costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz182-4" NAME="fr_pz182-4">2628</a> The Commission explained that adapting systems to report customer information that is not included in current regulatory data on a routine basis could require significant and potentially difficult reprogramming because it could require gathering information from separate systems within a broker-dealer&#8217;s infrastructure and consolidating it in one location, and redesigning an IT infrastructure to satisfy this requirement could interrupt other workflows within the broker-dealer, expanding the scope of systems that must be altered to accomplish CAT reporting.</p>
          <p id="5fa21462-1fbb-4732-8bd2-422927d618ae">The Commission received comments regarding the costs associated with reporting customer information. One commenter mentioned that the costs for providing customer information to the Central Repository represent a significant proportion of costs to the total industry.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz182-5" NAME="fr_pz182-5">2629</a> One commenter requested clarification that only active accounts are reported as part of the customer definition process, and as a result of such clarification, this could reduce costs incurred for reporting customer information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz182-6" NAME="fr_pz182-6">2630</a> Two commenters stated that including Customer Identifying Information on the Initial Order Report would result in significant costs for the industry.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz182-7" NAME="fr_pz182-7">2631</a></p>
          <p id="4d7dcc04-e28d-45f8-b09a-2d6d24e074de">The Participants responded to the comment regarding clarification of reporting only active accounts, stating that they have proposed to add a definition of &#8220;Active Account&#8221;, defined as an account that has had activity in Eligible Securities within the last six months. Additionally, the Participants propose amending Section 6.4(d)(iv) of the Plan to clarify that each Industry Member must submit an initial set of customer information for Active Accounts at the commencement of reporting to the Central Repository, as well as any updates, additions, or other changes in customer information, including any such customer information for any new Active Accounts.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz183-5" NAME="fr_pz183-5">2632</a> In response to the comments regarding the expense associated with reporting Customer Identifying Information in the Initial Order Report, the Participants recommended modifications to the Plan to clarify that Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information does not need to be included on the Initial Order Report.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AXq0z" NAME="fr_AXq0z">2633</a></p>
          <p id="04b69aea-3ebc-453b-a0c3-fafb4fa10477">The Commission considered these comments, the Participants&#8217; response and modifications to the Plan, and continues to believe that the requirement in the CAT NMS Plan to report customer information represents a significant proportion of total costs to the industry. No commenter provided cost estimates that would allow the Commission to estimate the costs, however. Further, the economic analysis did not explicitly account for Customer Identifying Information and Customer Account Information on the Initial Order Report, and the modification clarifies that the Plan does not require this information on order origination.</p>
          <p id="a999d00b-a4b9-4578-a4c9-0636a4d22051">(2) Material Terms of the Order</p>
          <p id="13515d51-2b4e-4c9d-a6f4-a004c748097b">In the Notice, the Commission preliminarily explained that the requirement to report Material Terms of the Order that include an open/close indicator for equities, order display information, and special handling instructions represent a significant source of cost. The Commission observed that not all broker-dealers are required to report these elements on every order and no market participants report an open/close indicator on orders to buy or sell equities. Thus, adapting some market participants&#8217; systems to report this information for each transaction could require significant and potentially difficult reprogramming that requires centralizing or copying information from multiple IT systems within the broker-dealer, which could dramatically increase the costs associated with implementing the changes required by CAT.</p>
          <p id="ceac0924-bbb1-4824-a52b-82249f2001e0">The Commission received comments on the costs of the open/close indicator, but did not receive comments on other components of the Material Terms of the Order. Three commenters agreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis that an open/close indicator represents a significant proportion of costs of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-3" NAME="fr_pz184-3">2634</a> Two commenters indicated that it would require significant process changes across multiple systems,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-4" NAME="fr_pz184-4">2635</a> and one provided a list of the different types of systems impacted by the open/close indicator.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-5" NAME="fr_pz184-5">2636</a> Three commenters mentioned that currently, the open/close indicator is not populated for equities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-6" NAME="fr_pz184-6">2637</a> One of these commenters mentioned the inclusion of the open/close indicator for equities represents a &#8220;market structure change.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-7" NAME="fr_pz184-7">2638</a> Further, several commenters implied that the costs of the open/close indicator were not included in the cost estimates in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz184-8" NAME="fr_pz184-8">2639</a> The Participants did not directly address the costs of the open/close indicator but did indicate that it is currently only captured on certain options orders, implying that including this field in the Plan would be costly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AGBRB" NAME="fr_AGBRB">2640</a> In particular, the Participants&#8217; response indicates that the open/close indicator is not captured on equities or on certain options transactions such as Options&#8217; Market Maker transactions.</p>
          <p id="3989efc4-d639-4dbc-b40d-bc3fd7051a5d">The Commission considered these comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan and is updating and revising its economic analysis regarding the costs of the open/close indicator for equities and certain options transactions below.</p>
          <p id="2b255916-1e33-40c2-a769-7ed458fbbe85">The modifications to the Plan eliminating the requirement to report an open/close indicator for equities will reduce the compliance costs for broker-dealers, Participants, and the Central Repository, but the Commission cannot quantify the savings. While several commenters implied that the cost estimates in the Notice did not account for the open/close indicator in equities, the Commission notes that this data field was proposed in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and discussed in the Proposing Release and Notice. Nonetheless, the commenters represent many broker-dealers and, therefore, the comments may indicate that a number of broker-dealers indeed did not include these costs when responding to the cost survey. This raises uncertainty regarding how many broker-dealers did or did not account for these costs. Because of this uncertainty and the absence of comments detailing the costs, the Commission cannot update its cost estimates to recognize the Plan modifications. However, both the Commission and commenters agree that, absent a modification, market participants would have needed to adapt their systems to report open/close information for each order because this indicator is not populated for equities today.</p>

While the economic analysis in the Notice did not explicitly separate the costs associated with an open/close indicator for equities and an open/close indicator for options, the Commission continues to believe that the costs of the open/close indicator for options are included in the cost estimates above because the commenters who implied that the cost estimates do not include estimates of the open/close indicator specifically mentioned equities and not options. But because the Plan will no longer require the reporting of the open/close indicator for Options Market Maker transactions, the Commission now believes there will be additional cost savings associated with not having to report this indicator as part of CAT.</p>

          <p id="aeda8b4f-783a-46e9-8589-c97bbe2e323e">In the Notice, the Commission explained its preliminary belief that the requirement to use listing exchange symbology could represent a significant source of costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz186-5" NAME="fr_pz186-5">2641</a> The Commission explained that because broker-dealers do not necessarily use listing exchange symbology when placing orders on other exchanges or off-exchange, this requirement could require broker-dealers to perform a translation process on their data before they submit CAT Data to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz186-6" NAME="fr_pz186-6">2642</a> The translation process could be costly to design and perform, and result in errors that would be costly for the broker-dealers to correct. If other elements of the Plan were to necessitate a translation, then the listing exchange symbology could be fairly low cost because it would be just another step in the translation. However, if the Plan has no other requirement that would necessitate a translation, the Commission explained that the costs of including listing exchange symbology on all CAT reports would include the costs of designing and performing the translation as well as the costs of correcting any errors caused by the translation.</p>
          <p id="02d2a231-cf63-490d-a897-acba8c86b951">The Commission received several comments regarding costs associated with CAT Reporters using listing exchange symbology.

Specifically, the Commission is incorporating the information from the Participants&#8217; response into its baseline of current broker-dealer practices. Because the Commission believes that broker-dealers already translate their order messages when routing orders, they should be able to apply those translations to other types of messages before recording the events or reporting them to CAT at a relatively low cost. Therefore, the Commission now believes that the incremental cost for CAT Reporters to translate from their existing symbology to listing exchange symbology would be smaller than as discussed in the Notice and would not be a substantial contributor to aggregate costs. This revised conclusion is consistent with commenters who indicated there would be costs, but did not indicate they would be large and did not provide cost estimates.</p>

The Commission understood that currently some broker-dealers already record allocation times, but that the broker-dealers that do not currently record these times will face implementation costs associated with changing their business processes to record them. The Commission explained that implementation costs for allocation reporting may include significant costs associated with incorporating additional systems into firms&#8217; regulatory data reporting infrastructure to facilitate this reporting, if such systems would not already be involved in recording or reporting order events. Furthermore, the Commission explained that Outsourcers could face significant implementation and ongoing costs associated with reporting Allocation Reports if their service bureaus do not extend their services to manage the servers that handle allocations.</p>

Based on the results of the survey, the commenter estimated that the currently proposed allocation timestamp requirement, with a one millisecond timestamp granularity and a 50 millisecond clock offset, would cost the industry $88,775,000 in initial implementation costs and $13,925,000 in ongoing annual costs. The commenter further estimated that a modified allocation timestamp requirement, with a one second timestamp granularity and a one second clock offset, would cost the industry $44,050,000 in initial implementation costs and $5,035,833 in ongoing annual costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz189-5" NAME="fr_pz189-5">2651</a> The commenter also indicated that neither the survey of broker-dealers used to estimate the cost estimates in the Plan nor the survey used to estimate the costs of clock synchronization requirements included the requirement of timestamps on Allocation Reports.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AhjFS" NAME="fr_AhjFS">2652</a></p>

Further, the Commission has analyzed the public information on the dates of the CAT Reporter survey and the release of public information on the inclusion of Allocation Time. In recognition of the modification to the timestamp granularity and the realization that Allocation Time costs were not included in the cost estimates in the Notice, the Commission is now adding the commenter&#8217;s estimate of $44,050,000 in implementation costs and $5,035,833 in ongoing costs to the estimates of costs to broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz190-7" NAME="fr_pz190-7">2654</a></p>

Also, the Commission&#8217;s estimate of &#188; FTE for the clock synchronization implementation costs for Outsourcers is in line with its estimate of 1 FTE for the overall implementation costs for Outsourcers whereas multiplying the estimate from the survey results by the number of Outsourcers would yield a result that would be approximately 87% of the Commission&#8217;s estimates for total implementation costs for outsourcers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz196-4" NAME="fr_pz196-4">2675</a> The Commission agrees, however, that the average cost calculated in the FIF Clock Offset Survey included an inherent downward bias due to the selection of the minimum value in the highest cost response range when calculating the average.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz196-5" NAME="fr_pz196-5">2676</a> In conclusion, while the Commission recognizes a degree of uncertainty in its clock synchronization cost estimates, which may be downward biased, the commenter does not offer an alternative cost estimate, and the Commission does not have enough information to change its estimate.</p>

          <p id="149fdbe7-d01f-4ce1-8041-712b0558b1fb">As discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz202-7" NAME="fr_pz202-7">2693</a> the Participants&#8217; response provided clarifying information on error correction timelines for customer information and PII, and identified an errant discussion of these error correction timelines in the Plan. The Commission is amending the Plan to incorporate the Participants&#8217; clarification. The Commission does not believe the clarification regarding the timeline for communication of errors for customer and account information would warrant any changes to its analysis and conclusions regarding costs.</p>
          <p id="bbeaf908-9ee8-4b90-87ea-ffe991d72b65">The Commission is also amending the Plan require that the CAT testing environment will be made available to Industry Members on a voluntary basis no later than six months prior to when Industry Members are required to report and that more coordinated, structured testing of the CAT System will begin no later than three months prior to when Industry Members are required to report data to CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz202-8" NAME="fr_pz202-8">2694</a> These amendments could increase the costs of the Plan as they relate to the provision of a testing environment.</p>
          <p id="ab4b6707-1dcb-48d3-86e7-f3aa44aacaad">b. Fees</p>
          <p id="02d03a99-8eb8-4c87-b0a9-0f9b28379c95">In the Notice, the Commission discussed a source of costs due to ancillary fees on both broker-dealers reporting to, and regulators accessing, the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz202-9" NAME="fr_pz202-9">2695</a> The Commission preliminarily believed that ancillary fees levied on broker-dealers were unlikely to be levied broadly, because discussion in the Plan associated these fees with late and/or inaccurate reporting. The Plan also discussed ancillary fees possibly levied on regulators associated with the use of Central Repository data. The Commission recognized that costs estimated in Bids for constructing and operating the Central Repository already anticipate use of the CAT Data by regulators, and that additional fees to access the data might give regulators incentives to make less use of the data than anticipated in the Benefits Section. However, any fee schedule proposed by the Participants would be filed with the Commission. Consequently, the Commission preliminarily did not believe that the provisions for ancillary fees would likely significantly impact the costs or benefits of CAT.</p>
          <p id="406579ae-9630-4df1-bdc3-565c62d2ee5d">Three commenters supported levying fees on regulators that access CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz203-4" NAME="fr_pz203-4">2696</a> One commenter mentioned that any costs imposed in connection with a usage fee for the CAT will be offset by the costs that the SROs will save in retiring systems. In fact, imposing a user fee could create an incentive to eliminate those systems in a timely fashion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz203-5" NAME="fr_pz203-5">2697</a> While the Participants agreed there are potential benefits to charging a usage fee, they also stated that it is premature to establish such a fee until the Participants gain a better understanding of how the Plan will be used by the regulators and how such usage will impact the operational costs of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AALi" NAME="fr_AALi">2698</a></p>
          <p id="56b53484-3fcb-4fbe-8958-f92568c50105">The Commission considered these comments, but does not believe that they would warrant changes to the Commission&#8217;s preliminary analysis and conclusions regarding the ancillary fees under the Plan. Furthermore there were no modifications to the Plan that would warrant changes to this aspect of the economic analysis. The Commission disagrees with the comment that the usage fees would create an incentive for SROs to retire their systems earlier. In fact, the Commission notes that the usage fees could have the opposite effect &#8211; it could encourage the SROs to not use CAT for regulatory activities other than surveillance, which could incentivize them to retain these systems longer. The Commission continues to believe that ancillary costs do not represent a significant proportion of costs of the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

          <p id="3d8776b4-2177-4afd-a434-0b00286a5431">In the Notice, the Commission recognized that investors and market participants could face significant costs if CAT Data security were breached.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-6" NAME="fr_pz204-6">2699</a> The Commission explained its belief that it is difficult to form reliable economic expectations for the costs of security breaches because there are few examples of security breaches analogous to the type that could occur under the CAT NMS Plan. However, the Commission provided a qualitative analysis of the expected costs of security breaches in the Notice by separating the expected costs of security breaches into two components: the risk of a security breach and the cost resulting from a security breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-7" NAME="fr_pz204-7">2700</a></p>
          <p id="13fc5475-7c31-4dd2-baa8-6a43e6681b00">The Commission acknowledged in the Notice<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-8" NAME="fr_pz204-8">2701</a> that because many of the decisions that define security measures for the Central Repository are coincident with the selection of the Plan Processor, there is a degree of uncertainty with regards to security measures that would be implemented by the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz204-9" NAME="fr_pz204-9">2702</a> Consequently, there is uncertainty about the significance of the risks, the expected costs of a breach when considering the likelihood of a data breach, and the second-order effects.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz205-7" NAME="fr_pz205-7">2703</a></p>
          <p id="7158c6c4-3574-4196-ba7d-fbd00209c41e">a. Costs of a Security Breach</p>
          <p id="8bd6670b-27bf-4fe1-9047-0adba0992548">The Commission discussed its belief in the Notice<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz205-8" NAME="fr_pz205-8">2704</a> that the form of the direct costs resulting from a security breach will vary across market participants and could be significant. It listed the following four types of costs. First, for broker-dealers, investment advisers, and other similar institutions, a security breach could leak highly-confidential information about trading strategies or positions,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz205-9" NAME="fr_pz205-9">2705</a> which could be deleterious for market participants&#8217; trading profits and client relationships. Second, a data breach could also expose proprietary information about the existence of a significant business relationship with either a counterparty or client, which could reduce business profits.</p>
          <p id="af15c458-f928-4377-8c8d-dd296ada4ac5">Third, a data breach could also potentially reveal PII of customers. Because some of the CAT Data stored in the Central Repository will contain PII such as names, addresses, and social security numbers, a security breach could raise the possibility of identity theft, which currently costs Americans billions of dollars per year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz206-4" NAME="fr_pz206-4">2706</a> Because PII will be stored in a single, centralized location rather than stored across multiple locations, a breach in the Central Repository could leak all PII, rather than a subset of PII that could be leaked if the information were stored in multiple locations. As such, these costs associated with the risk of a security breach could be substantial in aggregate.</p>
          <p id="787fe124-669c-4897-9535-75ce2ad31fc0">Fourth, a breach that reveals the activities of regulators within the Central Repository, such as data on the queries and processes run on query results, could compromise regulatory efforts or lead to speculation that could falsely harm the reputation of market participants and investors.</p>
          <p id="6ce2ba34-47a7-41fc-827f-5503604b8ef8">The Commission received several comments regarding the costs of a security breach, which are summarized in more detail in Section IV.D.6. Some commenters asserted that the potential costs of a breach exceed those described by the Commission in the Notice because a breach could negatively affect not just individual firms and investors but also the broader financial markets. One commenter wrote that a bad actor gaining access to the Central Repository &#8220;may pose tremendous threat to the U.S. financial stability.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz206-5" NAME="fr_pz206-5">2707</a> Another wrote that a breach could be a &#8220;threat to market stability or national security&#8221; and &#8220;would have serious impacts on the global economy.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AXJqu" NAME="fr_AXJqu">2708</a> The same commenter stated that &#8220;we believe the CAT Data is on par with, and meets, the standards for classified information as set in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security Information. . . . We think that unauthorized disclosure or use of CAT Data could destabilize the U.S. and world financial markets by causing investor panic, mass selling and runs on financial institutions. The potential extent of damage to the U.S. markets and economy would be a matter of national security.&#8221; Another commenter cited the Government Accountability Office, stating &#8220;the ineffective protection of cyber assets can result in the loss or unauthorized disclosure or alteration of information, [which] could lead to serious consequences and result in substantial harm to individuals and to the federal government.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz207-3" NAME="fr_pz207-3">2709</a></p>
          <p id="70e5a22e-1fc3-473e-bcf0-769415ad29a3">Commenters also asserted that the potential costs of a breach exceed those described by the Commission in the Notice because the Notice did not discuss costs related to breach management. One commenter stated that &#8220;the Proposal fails to address who is responsible for the cost of the breach that occurs at the Central Repository,&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz207-4" NAME="fr_pz207-4">2710</a> and another commenter suggested that &#8220;[because] the Plan Processor is responsible for constructing and operating the CAT . . . the Plan Processor should bear responsibility in the event of a data breach.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz207-5" NAME="fr_pz207-5">2711</a> One commenter wrote that &#8220;the cost of complying with the notification requirements under the Privacy Laws may be exorbitant.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz207-6" NAME="fr_pz207-6">2712</a> Two commenters recommended the purchase of insurance by the Plan Processor or CAT NMS, LLC to cover the costs of a breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz207-7" NAME="fr_pz207-7">2713</a> One commenter argued that the Plan Processor must promptly notify a customer of security breaches of his data because &#8220;a security breach of a customer&#8217;s trading data could compromise the customer&#8217;s investment strategies even if the customer&#8217;s PII was not compromised.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz208-6" NAME="fr_pz208-6">2714</a> Another commenter observed that breach notification may take longer if the data breach happens at the site of a Participant, &#8220;which could greatly harm registered funds and other victims of the breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz208-7" NAME="fr_pz208-7">2715</a></p>
          <p id="af72b799-2dff-463a-ae12-1f860a947b21">The Commission acknowledges that the costs of a breach, including breach management, could be quite high, especially during periods of market stress. Furthermore, the Commission understands that a breach could seriously harm not only investors and institutions but also the broader financial markets. The Commission is unable to provide quantitative estimates of those costs because there are few examples of security breaches analogous to the type that could occur under the Plan and because the Plan Processor has some discretion in developing its breach management plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz208-8" NAME="fr_pz208-8">2716</a> The Commission notes, however, that the Plan Processor is responsible for CAT Data,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz208-9" NAME="fr_pz208-9">2717</a> and it will develop a breach protocol and cyber incident response plan that will include notification of breach victims such as Customers, insurance coverage and liability, and details about the distribution of costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz208-10" NAME="fr_pz208-10">2718</a></p>

          <p id="2befaee6-4379-49f2-9953-a95b67e3939e">The Commission discussed in the Notice<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz208-11" NAME="fr_pz208-11">2719</a> its belief that the risks of a security breach may not be significant because certain provisions of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and the CAT NMS Plan appear reasonably designed to mitigate these risks. However, the Commission noted that the considerable diversity in the potential security approaches of the Bidders creates some uncertainty about the effectiveness of the eventual security procedures and hence, the risk of a security breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-3" NAME="fr_pz209-3">2720</a></p>
          <p id="0923e2c2-f296-42c8-8b0f-d89d84a3c7ba">In the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-4" NAME="fr_pz209-4">2721</a> the Commission discussed the provisions of both <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and the Plan that provide safeguards designed to prevent security breaches.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-5" NAME="fr_pz209-5">2722</a> First, governance provisions of the CAT NMS Plan could mitigate the risk of a security breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-6" NAME="fr_pz209-6">2723</a> Second, the Plan includes specific provisions designed to ensure the security of data in-flight.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz209-7" NAME="fr_pz209-7">2724</a> Third, Section 6.7(g) of the Plan requires that the Participants establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (1) ensure the confidentiality of the CAT Data obtained from the Central Repository; and (2) limit the use of CAT Data obtained from the Central Repository solely for surveillance and regulatory purposes. Finally, the Plan includes further provisions designed to provide security for PII.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-4" NAME="fr_pz210-4">2725</a></p>
          <p id="a9ebf5d0-ffff-42e2-8eee-9ea4e41bb995">Commenters made four types of comments about the Notice&#8217;s economic analysis of the risk of a security breach. The first type of comment relates to protecting CAT Data that are extracted or downloaded from the Central Repository. Several commenters expressed strong concerns about allowing any entity, including regulators, to extract or download data from the Central Repository because the risk of any data breach would greatly increase as the data are maintained at more sites.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-5" NAME="fr_pz210-5">2726</a> One commenter suggested that allowing anyone to download the entire CAT database might threaten U.S. financial stability.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-6" NAME="fr_pz210-6">2727</a> Some commenters also objected to excluding the Commission or its Staff from certain security-related parts of the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-7" NAME="fr_pz210-7">2728</a></p>
          <p id="acafd2e0-7e1e-45b4-9087-143f6cfc516a">The second type of comment relates to tailoring security requirements to the security risk of the particular data element. Several commenters argued that at-rest data and in-use data needs to have some of the same security measures that are required for in-flight data in order to keep risk at an acceptable level.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz210-8" NAME="fr_pz210-8">2729</a> Another commenter wrote that maintaining different security standards for PII data and non-PII data &#8220;creates the misimpression that all non-PII data merits less information security protection than PII data&#8221; and recommended more accurately matching security requirements to the underlying risk through the imposition of &#8220;additional levels of data classification to protect adequately commercially sensitive non-PII data.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-4" NAME="fr_pz211-4">2730</a></p>
          <p id="e726a412-5013-438e-a13b-6224d8fdbb72">The third type of comment relates to the overall risks of the system due to the unique nature of the database. Several commenters suggested that the Commission impose additional security requirements beyond what appears in the Notice because the scale and scope of the Central Repository will make it a particularly attractive target for well-funded hackers, individuals, and nation-states with objectives ranging from theft to insider trading to market disruption.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-5" NAME="fr_pz211-5">2731</a> Additionally, a number of commenters recommended that the Plan include additional detail concerning the security of CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-6" NAME="fr_pz211-6">2732</a></p>
          <p id="0e2917e0-46cf-43b2-ae55-9fc70640659b">The fourth type of comment relates to data governance. One commenter stated that the proposal for the CCO and CISO to be officers of the Company as well as employees of the Plan Processor creates a conflict of interest that would undermine the ability of these officers to carry out their responsibilities effectively under the Plan because they would owe a fiduciary duty to the Plan Processor rather than the CAT LLC. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz211-7" NAME="fr_pz211-7">2733</a> The same commenter noted that the Notice did not specify the entity liable in the event of a data breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AQ8Vz" NAME="fr_AQ8Vz">2734</a> The commenter suggested that because the Plan Processor is responsible for constructing and operating the CAT, with the oversight of the Operating Committee, and will be solely in control of the system&#8217;s information security, the Plan Processor should bear responsibility in the event of a data breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz212-4" NAME="fr_pz212-4">2735</a></p>

          <p id="d6456eef-64b3-4489-a906-415773eaac8f">The Commission has considered the comment letters and the Participants&#8217; response letters. In response to the commenters that expressed concern about allowing any entity to extract or download CAT Data, the Commission notes that it believes that regulators need access to CAT Data outside the Central Repository to perform their duties effectively. As discussed above in Section IV.D.6.d, Participants that choose to extract or download CAT Data must have policies and procedures regarding CAT Data security that are equivalent to those of the Plan Processor for the Central Repository. And as discussed in Section IV.D.6.o, the rules and policies applicable to the Commission and its Staff will be different yet substantively as rigorous as those applicable to the Participants and their personnel. The Commission therefore believes that, due to these precautions, the regulatory use of CAT Data outside the Central Repository should not increase the security risks to the CAT system.</p>
          <p id="6a75114d-344e-4327-9d87-8cf3e101e3a1">In response to the commenters that expressed concern about the security requirements for particular data elements, the Commission notes that it believes that the best use of limited resources is to tailor security requirements to the security risk of the particular data element. No commenter quantified the relative risk of a breach that comes from in-flight data versus at-rest data or in-use data, and the Commission continues to believe that the largest risk of a breach comes from in-flight data. Thus, the adopted Plan will maintain higher security standards for inflight data than for at-rest data or in-use data. The Commission also continues to believe that PII data warrants more security considerations than non-PII data, but it disagrees with the one commenter that recommended multiple levels of security for non-PII data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAYR5" NAME="fr_pAYR5">2746</a> In this case, the Commission does not believe that the benefits justify the costs of creating additional levels of data classification within non-PII data.</p>
          <p id="c6905fa9-30c5-45a0-94d9-1e632483dc30">In response to the commenters that expressed concern about the risks of aggregating confidential data from disparate sources into one location, the Commission notes that it agrees that the CAT Data will be a particularly attractive target for bad actors. However, the Commission believes that the extensive, robust security requirements in the adopted Plan, as outlined in <a href="#7fa1a9a2-1d0e-4da6-9af8-47f5cafc6260">Section IV.D.6</a>, provide appropriate, adequate protection for the CAT Data.</p>
          <p id="b4e9bcf1-f24e-433e-8a20-72ade10b1c42">In response to the comments regarding the lack of security details in the Plan, the Commission continues to believe that, as discussed in the Notice, there is a degree of uncertainty with respect to the security measures that would be implemented by the Plan Processor, and consequently, uncertainty about the risk of a data breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAHU3R" NAME="fr_pAHU3R">2747</a> As discussed in more detail above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A1-Z" NAME="fr_A1-Z">2748</a> the Commission notes that the Participants have provided some additional information regarding security procedures. Additionally, as discussed above, the Commission is amending the Plan to require that the Participants conduct background checks for the employees and contractors of the Participants that will use the CAT System,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ALJC" NAME="fr_ALJC">2749</a> and to require that the Participants provide the Commission with an evaluation of the information security program to ensure that the program is consistent with the highest industry standards for the protection of data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ADMku" NAME="fr_ADMku">2750</a> The Commission believes that this additional information mitigates some of the uncertainty, but continues to believe that there is significant uncertainty with respect to the risk of a breach. However, the Commission also recognizes that publicly releasing too many details about security requirements could create additional risk, and as discussed in <a href="#7fa1a9a2-1d0e-4da6-9af8-47f5cafc6260">Section IV.D.6</a>, believes a reasonable level of detail has been provided.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz216-4" NAME="fr_pz216-4">2751</a></p>
          <p id="51a79f83-7401-4e5c-9753-0b6ae4bc55ad">In response to comments about governance, the Commission notes that it has modified the Plan to address the concern regarding potential conflicts of interest on the part of the CCO and CISO. Specifically, as discussed in more detail above in <a href="#d10e85cb-2d30-4372-8b54-a2c932fcdea8">Section IV.B.3</a>, the CCO and CISO will have fiduciary duties to the CAT LLC in the same manner and extent as an officer of a Delaware corporation, and to the extent those duties conflict with duties the CCO and CISO have to the Plan Processor, the duties to the CAT LLC will control.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AUHS" NAME="fr_AUHS">2752</a> As discussed above in <a href="#7fa1a9a2-1d0e-4da6-9af8-47f5cafc6260">Section IV.D.6</a>, the CCO and CISO each have responsibilities related the security of CAT Data, and the potential for a conflict of interest could create uncertainty as to whether these responsibilities will be carried out in a way that will minimize the risk of a security breach. The Commission believes that the modifications to the Plan should reduce this uncertainty.</p>
          <p id="1eb663e8-dde9-4a44-99d2-ef4c03152bd1">In response to the commenter who noted that the Notice did not specify the entity liable in the event of a data breach, the Commission notes that the Plan requires the Plan Processor&#8217;s cyber incident response plan to address insurance issues related to security breaches, and that as part of the discussions on insurance coverage and liability, further detail about the distribution of costs will be undertaken, including details about who might bear the cost of a breach and under what specific circumstances. The Commission believes that these provisions in the Plan should provide incentives for the Plan Processor to manage security risks. However, because the cyber incident response plan will not be developed until after the Plan Processor has been selected, the Commission does not know whether or under what circumstances the Plan Processor will bear the cost of a breach. While the Commission recognizes that this creates some uncertainty with respect to the incentives on the Plan Processor to minimize the risk of a security breach, the Commission is approving the Plan without further modification for the reasons discussed in <a href="#7fa1a9a2-1d0e-4da6-9af8-47f5cafc6260">Section IV.D.6.j</a>, above.</p>

          <p id="8c5a12e6-6a4e-4d4a-86e9-4b4c9f6598d4">In the Notice, the Commission recognized that the desire to avoid direct costs of a security breach could motivate actions that would cause second order effects.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz217-8" NAME="fr_pz217-8">2754</a> The Commission illustrated this in the Notice by considering two specific examples of actions that Participants might take. First, if service bureaus perceive the costs and risks of a security breach to be great enough because of the addition of PII in the data, which is not included in current data, some could decide not to provide CAT Data reporting services.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz217-9" NAME="fr_pz217-9">2755</a> Second, investors or other market participants could move their activity off-shore or cease market participation altogether to avoid having sensitive information stored in the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-5" NAME="fr_pz218-5">2756</a> The Commission stated that it did not believe that the effect of the Plan on the risk or costs of a data breach would be great enough to result in significant second order effects.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-6" NAME="fr_pz218-6">2757</a></p>
          <p id="e332fb8e-2e0e-42f4-809c-34d01327d77d">The Commission received two comments on this issue. Both comments suggested that industry members would have to purchase insurance or cease domestic operations if the Plan Processor was not required to purchase an insurance policy that covers potential security breaches and extends to industry members to reimburse them for costs related to the breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-7" NAME="fr_pz218-7">2758</a> Comments on another potential second order effect related to capital formation are addressed in more detail below in Section V.G.3.b.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz218-8" NAME="fr_pz218-8">2759</a></p>
          <p id="ddfeb05b-a666-4740-8d38-461870f9fcba">In their response to comments, the Participants indicated that they are working on an agreement between themselves and the potential Plan Processors to cover liability, insurance, and indemnification, which would also make it less likely that industry members would move off-shore or cease operations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AJzod" NAME="fr_AJzod">2760</a></p>
          <p id="729ad2fc-9bf1-47ac-b94d-070e82e9eeea">The Commission recognizes that the purchase of insurance to cover these costs is a potential second order effect. As such, the Commission is revising its economic analysis to acknowledge this additional second order effect, but otherwise continues to believe that the security-related second order effects will be as anticipated in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="c59ca158-1014-47ed-930e-740a6379c987">b. Changes to CAT Reporter Behavior</p>
          <p id="0d2bce81-8c1c-4827-9137-da43904f04f4">In the Notice, the Commission also acknowledged that increased surveillance could impose some costs by altering the behavior of market participants. The Commission stated that benefits could accrue to the extent that improved surveillance, investigation, and enforcement capabilities allow for regulators to better identify and address violative behavior when it occurs, and to the extent that common knowledge of improved capabilities deters violative behavior.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA3JS" NAME="fr_pA3JS">2761</a> In particular, the Commission acknowledged that some market participants could reduce economically beneficial behavior if those market participants believe that, because of enhanced surveillance, their activities would increase the level of regulatory scrutiny that they bear. Furthermore, the Commission stated that costs could accrue to the extent that some forms of market activity, which are permissible and economically beneficial to the market and investors, could come under greater scrutiny, which could create a disincentive to engage in that activity. For example, regulators could increase the number of inspections, examinations and enforcement proceedings that they initiate. To the extent that these activities result in a reduction in violative behavior, the market benefits by avoiding the costs of this behavior. To the extent, however, the additional regulatory activity increases the number of inspections, examinations and enforcement on permissible activities, market participants would incur the increased costs of facilitating these regulatory inquiries.</p>
          <p id="01b34c0c-41b6-4e16-a51e-e96aca29981f">Although the Commission did not receive any comments on the second order effects it discussed in the Notice, it did receive two comments on a second order effect related to the granularity of timestamps. As discussed in the Notice, the Plan requires CAT reporters to report sub-millisecond timestamps when the CAT reporter uses such timestamps internally.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz220-3" NAME="fr_pz220-3">2762</a> Two commenters noted that this requirement may discourage CAT reporters from using sub-millisecond timestamps internally, since this would require finer timestamp resolution in CAT reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz220-4" NAME="fr_pz220-4">2763</a> The Commission also received a comment on a second-order effect that could result from the tiered fee structure of broker-dealers based on message traffic.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz220-5" NAME="fr_pz220-5">2764</a> The commenter suggested that the structure of the funding model might cause second-order effects related to the differential message traffic of different activities, and these effects may vary across securities based on their liquidity.</p>
          <p id="673df3b7-bea2-4378-8c35-33dec0c21f28">In response to comments on the granularity of timestamps, the Participants state that the quality of CAT Data would improve if the Plan required such timestamps to be reported by CAT reporters that use such timestamps internally.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AjXuT" NAME="fr_AjXuT">2765</a> Furthermore, in response to the comment that the imposition of a fee on message traffic would discourage liquidity provision, the Participants note that they actively considered the market quality concerns in devising the proposed funding model, and one of the reasons for proposing a tiered, fixed fee funding model was to limit the disincentives to providing liquidity to the market. In particular, the Participants believed that a funding model based on message volume was far more likely to affect market behavior.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAi2JL" NAME="fr_pAi2JL">2766</a></p>
          <p id="adc83e45-285e-4899-a636-ac4ccdb66f52">With regards to comments on sub-millisecond timestamps, the Commission acknowledges that this requirement may prove to be a disincentive for market participants to use sub-millisecond timestamps internally; however, the Commission believes that for many market participants, capturing timestamps at a finer resolution supports analysis of the firm&#8217;s data for business purposes that provide benefits such as improvement to trading strategies and measurement of execution costs, and the benefits of these business purposes may exceed the costs of reporting regulatory data with finer timestamps. However, the Commission acknowledges that for firms that do not perform such analyses, this requirement may prove to be a disincentive to adopting technologies that capture finer resolution timestamps.</p>
          <p id="9b417aab-c603-457f-9756-2ec1e7313a75">The Commission agrees with the comment about second order effects related to the tiering of broker-dealer fees based on message traffic and is adding this second-order effect to its analysis. The funding model anticipates Central Repository costs being spread across broker-dealers according to activity tiers based on message traffic. This may cause broker-dealers to alter their behavior to avoid being assigned to a higher fee tier. For example, trading strategies that involve providing liquidity might be expected to generate more message traffic than strategies that take liquidity because providing liquidity generally requires posting many quotes on many venues. Furthermore, while a broker-dealer is seeking to provide liquidity, market prices may change causing the broker-dealer to have to update its quotes on many venues multiple times as it seeks to trade. Consequently, the funding model may create an incentive to take rather than provide liquidity, which could reduce levels of market liquidity. Furthermore, these effects may vary across securities based on the liquidity of the security. As the commenter noted, &#8220;the quote-to-trade ratio for exchange-traded-products (&#8220;ETPs&#8221;) can be ten times greater than that for corporate stocks. This implies that market makers in ETPs may generate ten times the amount of message traffic per executed trade than market makers in corporate stock.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-5" NAME="fr_pz222-5">2767</a> Consequently, the Commission also agrees that the tiered funding model for broker-dealers may create disincentives to provide liquidity in less liquid securities, possibly resulting in less liquid markets for securities that are already considered illiquid. As discussed below, the Commission recognizes the potential differential effect on those broker-dealers that engage in market making in liquid stocks versus illiquid stocks and on those broker-dealers that engage in liquidity taking strategies versus those that engage in other strategies. Nonetheless, as explained above in <a href="#0361251e-3ef0-4ce3-bb3a-9b345a228c50">Section IV.D.13.b</a>, the Commission believes that the timestamp requirements contained in the CAT NMS Plan, including the requirement that a CAT Reporter report timestamps in increments finer than milliseconds if they do so in other systems, are reasonable and will improve regulators&#8217; ability to sequence events.</p>
          <p id="420d2aec-4298-4c1c-b4d3-d93d92594f64">c. Tiered Funding Model</p>
          <p id="578187ca-f97f-4e12-8860-de475f8289ce">In the Notice, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that establishing a small number of discrete fee tiers, as occurs under the Plan, could create incentives for CAT Reporters to alter their behavior to switch from one tier to another, thereby qualifying for lower fees.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz222-6" NAME="fr_pz222-6">2768</a> Specifically, the Plan states that CAT Reporters would be classified into a number of groups based on reporter type and market share of share volume or message traffic and assessed a fixed fee that is determined by this classification. The higher-activity groups would be assessed higher fees such that market participants who fall into the lower tiers have a fee advantage over the market participants that fall into the higher tiers. The Commission noted, however, that because this incentive is contingent on being near a fee-tier cutoff point, relatively few market participants will likely be affected and thus market quality effects will likely not be significant. Furthermore, for those market participants near a cutoff point, managing activity to avoid a higher fee tier would necessarily incur costs of lost business and potential loss of market share, and would possibly be difficult to implement, which should mitigate any effects on market quality.</p>
          <p id="a6c21d3d-2a97-4b6a-9359-411b53b1d0e7">The Commission also recognized that the tiering of fees could create calendar effects within markets. That is, the structure ultimately approved by the Operating Committee could affect market participant behavior near the end of a measuring period. For example, high levels of market activity during a measuring period might cause CAT Reporters to limit their activity near the end of a measurement period to avoid entering a higher fee tier. The Commission noted that the Operating Committee has discretion under the Plan governance structure to make the tier adjustments discussed in Section 11.1.d for individual CAT Reporters. This provision might mitigate incentives for individual market participants to alter market activities to reduce their expected CAT fees.</p>
          <p id="fe1ba6ec-2228-4eb9-abb8-2621db9c7b1a">The Commission did not receive any comments related to its economic analysis regarding the market quality effects, calendar effects, or other effects due to the tiered structure of the funding model. While the Commission is making certain modifications to the funding model, as described in Section IV.F above, the funding model will continue to utilize a tiered structure. Consequently, the Commission continues to believe that the tiered fee structure could create incentives for CAT Reporters to alter their behavior, but that market quality effects would likely not be significant. Nonetheless, the Commission expects that the required report by the Participants to study the impact of tiered-fees on market liquidity should provide insights into whether the fee model affects liquidity provision and ultimately market quality. This will assist the Commission&#8217;s oversight of the Plan and assist the Operating Committee in understanding whether it needs to make adjustments to the Funding Model. Furthermore, for those market participants near a cutoff point, managing activity to avoid a higher fee tier would necessarily incur costs of lost business and potential loss of market share, and would possibly be difficult to implement, which should mitigate any effects on market quality.</p>
          <p id="85860a30-82d9-40c1-b16e-2a1f15cab9ee">The Commission is also updating its analysis based on the amendment to the Plan to clarify that the Operating Committee may only change the tier to which a Person is assigned in accordance with a fee schedule filed with the Commission..<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz224-6" NAME="fr_pz224-6">2769</a> Consequently, the Commission no longer believes that this provision would mitigate incentives for individual market participants to alter market activities to reduce their expected CAT fees. The Commission continues to recognize that CAT Reporters may have incentives to alter their behavior to switch from one tier to another.</p>
          <p id="282a82d4-b7c8-4b55-a30d-cd4761a760c1">d. Differential CAT Fees across Market Participants</p>
          <p id="5d963991-2545-4efb-9fe0-7a9f44421590">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the funding model proposed in the Plan, which is a bifurcated funding model in which costs are first allocated between the group of all broker-dealers and the group of all Execution Venues, then within these groups by market activity level.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz225-3" NAME="fr_pz225-3">2770</a> The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the bifurcated funding model proposed in the Plan almost certainly would result in differential CAT costs between Execution Venues because it will assess fees differently on exchanges and ATSs. First, message traffic to and from an ATS would generate fee obligations on the broker-dealer that sponsors the ATS, while exchanges would incur almost no message traffic fees.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz225-4" NAME="fr_pz225-4">2771</a> Second, broker-dealers that internalize off-exchange order flow, generating off-exchange transactions outside of ATSs, would face a differential funding model compared to ATSs and exchanges.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A1S3" NAME="fr_A1S3">2772</a> Specifically, broker-dealers internalizing orders would only pay fees based on message traffic, whereas orders routed to ATSs and exchanges would lead to broker-dealer fees based on message traffic and ATS or exchange fees based on market share. If these fees are even partially passed on to customers, then the cost differentials that result might create incentives for broker-dealers to route order flow to those broker-dealers who internalize in order to minimize costs, creating a potential conflict of interest with broker-dealers&#8217; investor customers.</p>
          <p id="10b012d9-8d76-4368-8b8c-9f2ae8a18417">In addition, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the funding model shifts broker-dealer costs associated with the Central Repository to all broker-dealers and away from Options Market Makers. The Plan provides that broker-dealers would not report their options quotations, while equity market makers would report their equity quotations to the Central Repository. This differential treatment of market making quotes would affect funding costs by (a) decreasing the number of messages that must be reported and stored by Options Market Makers, and (b) charging broker-dealers that do not quote listed options a higher share of broker-dealer-assessed CAT fees than they would if Options Market Makers&#8217; quotes were included in the allocation of fees.</p>
          <p id="7bbea48c-2a0a-4d65-9e34-e8c393523f0e">Although this differential treatment would marginally increase the cost of providing other broker-dealer services relative to options market making, the Commission discussed its belief that this would not materially affect a market participant&#8217;s willingness to provide broker-dealer services other than options market making because (a) many market participants participate in both equities and options markets, and (b) broker-dealers participating in equity markets have significant infrastructure in place for serving that market and switching costs to participate in options market making are high.</p>
          <p id="be4ca0bf-eedc-46bb-b594-1b4178498765">In the Notice, the Commission also discussed the allocation of costs between the Execution Venues and the other Industry Members (i.e., broker-dealers) and solicited comment on alternative funding models.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz226-4" NAME="fr_pz226-4">2773</a> Specifically, the Commission noted that the CAT NMS Plan does not detail the proportions of fees to be borne by Execution Venues versus Industry Members. The Notice also pointed out that Execution Venues would be tiered by market share to determine their fees while Industry Members would be tiered by message traffic. In its analysis, the Commission noted that assessing CAT costs on market participants by message traffic may have the benefit of aligning market participants&#8217; incentives with the Participants&#8217; stated goal of minimizing costs. The Commission also explained that while a broker-dealer&#8217;s choice of business model is likely to determine its level of message activity, the majority of an exchange&#8217;s message traffic is passive receipt of quote updates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz226-5" NAME="fr_pz226-5">2774</a> Further, because quotes must be updated on all exchanges when prices change, exchanges with low market share are likely to have more message traffic (incurring CAT fees) per executed transaction (generating revenue).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz227-4" NAME="fr_pz227-4">2775</a> The Commission further explained that bifurcated fee approaches, such as the one in the Plan, may cause one Execution Venue to be relatively cheaper if Execution Venues pass costs on to members and subscribers and may exacerbate conflicts of interest for broker-dealers routing customer orders.</p>
          <p id="5a9a3dfe-58e7-47ba-8cc3-41d43748b465">The Commission received comments that inform its analysis of differential fees across market participants, particularly focusing on the allocation to Participants versus broker-dealers. One commenter questioned why Participants were tiered by market share while broker-dealers were treated differently (by message traffic), and noted this could place a larger burden on market makers of liquid securities. The commenter explicitly stated that it is not suggesting that market-share tiers are wrong, but believes there should be a reason why Participant tiers are based on one metric (market share) while broker-dealer tiers are based on another metric (message traffic).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ADzh" NAME="fr_ADzh">2776</a> The Commission received several comments on issues related to cost differentials between Participants and broker-dealers that were not discussed in the Notice. One commenter noted that the profits from the fees would only be distributed among the Participants and suggested these should be at least partially returned to broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-4" NAME="fr_pz228-4">2777</a> Another commenter was concerned that SROs would use CAT profits to fund other SRO operations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-5" NAME="fr_pz228-5">2778</a> There were comments regarding the lack of transparency over fee calculations and metrics used to determine tiers, as well as the determination of the allocation split between broker-dealers and Participants&#8212;all of which increases uncertainty in cost estimates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-6" NAME="fr_pz228-6">2779</a> Finally, there were a number of comments that described the potential for a conflict of interest in the allocation of fees, and discussing the relative burden of funding on broker-dealers to SROs, estimating that at least 88% of costs will be borne by broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-7" NAME="fr_pz228-7">2780</a></p>
          <p id="3c36681d-7d13-461c-812d-ac589b9421c8">There were no comments related to the economic analysis regarding a double charging of ATSs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-8" NAME="fr_pz228-8">2781</a> In addition, there were no comments regarding the economic analysis related to differences in costs between option market makers and equity market makers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-9" NAME="fr_pz228-9">2782</a></p>
          <p id="4a001dbb-694d-4900-ba48-4d4998efcbc2">The Participants&#8217; response contains information that is relevant to the economic analysis with regards to transparency in funding and the allocation of costs. Specifically, the Participants commented that the Plan provides the Advisory Committee with the right to receive information concerning the operation of the CAT,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz228-10" NAME="fr_pz228-10">2783</a> and that the Participants plan to provide the Advisory Committee with minutes of Operating Committee meetings.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz229-4" NAME="fr_pz229-4">2784</a> The response addressed the concerns over transparency in decision making; however, the concerns regarding uncertainty in the metrics used to determine tiers and the final cost allocation split will not be resolved until the Plan Processor is chosen.</p>
          <p id="c1344062-dc72-4efc-b13b-31eec91ef290">The Participants&#8217; supplemental response also contained information that is relevant to the economic analysis with respect to second order effects of the funding model. With regards to determining fees via message traffic for broker-dealers and market share for Participants, the Participants noted that message traffic is a key component of CAT operating costs, and that message traffic is strongly correlated with broker-dealer size. However, there is little correlation between message traffic and Execution Venue size, so charging large and small Execution Venues with similar message traffic would be inequitable. The Plan treats ATSs in the same manner as exchanges because their business models and anticipated burden on CAT are similar.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz229-5" NAME="fr_pz229-5">2785</a></p>
          <p id="f47c345c-bf37-4c51-b88a-0fa6fea387ff">On this topic, the Participants proposed one modification to the plan. The Participants proposed to amend the manner in which market share will be calculated for a national securities association that has trades reported by its members to its trade reporting facility or facilities for reporting transactions effected otherwise than on an exchange in NMS Stock or OTC Equity Securities. For such an association, its market share for purposes of the funding model would not include the share volume reported to the national securities association by an ATS, as such share volume will be included in the market share calculation for that ATS. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz229-6" NAME="fr_pz229-6">2786</a></p>
          <p id="44d2c0cf-91d1-4683-a197-94a2fd0cd1a8">The Participants also responded that they expect to operate the CAT on a break-even basis&#8212;that is, the fees imposed and collected would be intended to cover CAT costs and an appropriate reserve for CAT costs, and any surpluses would be treated as an operational reserve to offset fees in future payment. In addition, the Participants subsequently stated that the CAT LLC will seek to qualify for tax exempt status as a &#8220;business league.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz230-4" NAME="fr_pz230-4">&#8221;2787</a></p>
          <p id="a27fa0df-88ad-4176-be45-b1150ed2df3f">With regards to fee transparency, the Participants noted that the details regarding the tiers are important considerations and are actively developing the tiers. Once the Plan Processor is selected, the Operating Committee will work with the Processor to finalize the tiers, and broker-dealers and other participants will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal as part of the approval process for an immediately effective rule filing.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz230-5" NAME="fr_pz230-5">2788</a></p>
          <p id="2df65b40-f219-48b6-9cb2-e2d6e091bac1">With regards to the allocation of costs between Participants and broker-dealers and the potential for a conflict of interest in determining this allocation, the Participants noted that the proposed funding model is designed to recover costs associated with creating, implementing, and operating CAT as opposed to addressing costs of compliance, which might be incurred regardless of the funding model. In addition, there are over 100 times more broker-dealers expected to report to CAT than Participants. Therefore, the 88% aggregate cost figure quoted in the comments is less than what broker-dealers would be expected to pay in aggregate on a per-CAT reporter basis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A91P" NAME="fr_A91P">2789</a> With regard to the potential conflict of interest, the Participants noted that broker-dealers and the public will have the opportunity to comment on fees, the SEC will be required to evaluate the fees for consistency with the Exchange Act, the funding proposal expects that CAT will operate on a break-even basis, and Participants are prohibited from using regulatory fees for commercial purposes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAGiAq" NAME="fr_pAGiAq">2790</a></p>
          <p id="a7f4aad7-8a55-498c-9ff4-c79750abf53a">The Commission is revising its economic analysis in light of comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and Plan modifications. First, the Commission recognizes the validity of the comment that the funding tiers would place a larger burden on market makers of liquid securities relative to illiquid securities and place a lower burden on liquidity takers relative to those who provide liquidity. This could increase the incentive to broker-dealers to transact in more illiquid securities and reduce the incentive to provide liquidity. In response to the comment seeking the rationale behind the bifurcation in the funding model, the Commission notes that the Notice provided a rationale that the Commission continues to believe makes economic sense. Specifically, as summarized above, the Commission continues to believe that because message traffic is passive for exchanges and a business decision for Broker-Dealers, the bifurcated funding model will help align the incentives of market participants with the Participants&#8217; stated goal of minimizing costs. More broadly, the Commission continues to believe that because the CAT NMS Plan does not detail the proportions of fees to be borne by Execution Venues versus Industry Members, its economic analysis contains uncertainty regarding the differential fees to be borne by Execution Venues versus Industry Members.</p>
          <p id="0d2a89eb-c1b9-4c1b-9be5-baa32c82ab3d">With regards to the distribution of profits among SROs, the Commission is revising its economic analysis to incorporate the clarification in the Plan to the effect that profits from fees will go toward funding future costs instead of being redistributed among the SROs except in the two instances described above, as well as the modification to the Plan that reflects that the CAT LLC will seek to qualify for tax exempt status as a &#8220;business league.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz232-3" NAME="fr_pz232-3">2791</a> Broadly speaking, the Commission had been concerned about the competitive effects of distributing profits equally among SROs because, in profitable years, an equal distribution of profits would advantage smaller exchanges (larger exchanges in the case of losses). However, with the clarification and modification to the Plan, the Commission believes there will be little or no competitive effects resulting from distributions among SROs. The Commission also believes that this clarification and modification address commenter concerns about the distribution of CAT profits.</p>
          <p id="0587bc28-2695-4729-b868-0f785ff17b5e">The Commission is updating its analysis of the differential fees on exchanges and ATSs to incorporate Plan modifications that would change the way national securities associations are treated in the Funding Model. The modified Plan would no longer double-count ATS volume as share volume for the purposes of placing both ATSs and FINRA in tiers in the Funding Model. However, because of the uncertainty in the ultimate Funding Model, the Commission recognizes that this modification may not impact the fees paid by either ATSs or FINRA and may not alleviate any fee differentials between ATSs and exchanges. As described earlier in this Section, these fee differentials may arise because message traffic to and from an ATS would generate fee obligations on the broker-dealer that sponsors the ATS, while exchanges incur almost no message traffic fees.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz232-4" NAME="fr_pz232-4">2792</a></p>
          <p id="0d282606-3370-408c-ae09-01b3d1e1675a">In addition, the Commission notes that other over-the-counter volume, such as occurs when orders are executed off-exchange against a broker-dealer&#8217;s inventory, will still be assessed share volume fees while the message traffic that resulted in the executions will also be subject to fees through the broker-dealers that had order events related to the transactions. This contrasts to executions that occur on exchanges, where the venue that facilitates the execution does not pay fees for message traffic that led to the execution. This difference in treatment could still result in costs that are passed on to investors because broker-dealers have the incentive to route orders in a way that results in less order flow to those who pay higher CAT fees.</p>
          <p id="d3edccfe-6139-4d4d-8965-a16d974ad737">The Commission is not changing the economic analysis with respect to the allocation of costs between SROs and Broker-Dealers. As discussed in detail previously,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AE6I" NAME="fr_AE6I">2793</a> in response to the comments that suggested that Plan allocates 88% of the costs to broker-dealers, the Commission believes that the 88% figure cited is in reference to compliance costs, which are not &#8220;allocated&#8221; by the Plan. Fees to pay for the maintenance and operation of the Central Repository will be allocated via the funding model, and the current allocation of fees between broker-dealers and exchanges has not been determined.</p>
          <p id="f9aac036-d4c0-4396-a176-e1fbee80b906">The Commission is updating the Economic Analysis to reflect some improvements in financial transparency as a result of amendments to the Plan. Specifically, the Commission&#8217;s amendment to the Plan to require that CAT LLC financial statements be prepared in accordance with GAAP and audited by an independent public accounting firm may substitute to a certain extent for the added financial transparency sought by commenters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz234-7" NAME="fr_pz234-7">2794</a> Additionally, as per the Participants&#8217; response, all meeting minutes will be made available, and in addition, the Funding Model will be filed with the Commission and subject to public comment.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz234-8" NAME="fr_pz234-8">2795</a> However, the Commission continues to recognize uncertainty in the ultimate allocation of fees.</p>

        <p id="6362e14f-aad5-49ed-9527-04af379229db">In the Notice, the Commission&#8217;s analysis supported the preliminary belief that the Plan generally promotes competition.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz234-10" NAME="fr_pz234-10">2797</a> However, the Commission recognized that the Plan could increase barriers to entry because of the costs to comply with the Plan. Further, the Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice identified several limitations to competition, but stated that the Plan contains provisions to address some limitations and Commission oversight can also address the limitations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AAaE" NAME="fr_AAaE">2798</a></p>
        <p id="32226444-a5b3-4b60-b140-1cedaa030d9f">The Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice also supported the preliminary belief that the Plan would improve the efficiency of regulatory activities and enhance market efficiency by deterring violative activity that harms market efficiency. Further, the analysis in the Notice supported the Commission&#8217;s preliminary belief that the Plan would have modest positive effects on capital formation and that the threat of a security breach at the Central Repository would be unlikely to significantly harm capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz235-4" NAME="fr_pz235-4">2799</a></p>
        <p id="4d51a29e-1b28-41ef-97b9-40a3f6898642">At the same time, however, the Notice stated that the significant uncertainties discussed elsewhere in its economic analysis also affect the Commission&#8217;s analysis of efficiency, competition, and capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz235-5" NAME="fr_pz235-5">2800</a> Additionally, the Commission recognized that the Plan&#8217;s likely effects on competition, efficiency and capital formation were dependent to some extent on the performance and decisions of the Plan Processor and the Operating Committee in implementing the Plan, and thus there was necessarily some further uncertainty in the Commission&#8217;s analysis. Nonetheless, the Notice stated that the Commission preliminarily believed that the Plan contained certain governance provisions, as well as provisions relating to the selection and removal of the Plan Processor, that mitigate this concern regarding uncertainty by promoting decision-making that could, on balance, have positive effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.</p>
        <p id="7a59d731-5be9-4713-8fdf-2644cf9387a6">Overall, after considering comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan, the Commission is updating and revising its economic analysis of competition, efficiency, and capital formation. However, the revisions in the analysis do not impact the Commission&#8217;s broad conclusions. The Commission continues to believe that the Plan generally will promote competition, improve the efficiency of regulatory activities, promote market efficiency, and have modest positive effects on capital formation. Further, the Commission continues to recognize the significant uncertainty and that certain provisions of the Plan could promote efficient decisions and implementation and could provide competitive incentives to the Plan Processor to promote good performance.</p>

          <p id="f6d02ab1-a319-420b-903c-3d6d8611705b">In the Notice, the Commission analyzed the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s likely economic effects on competition in the market for trading services, as compared to the Baseline of the competitive environment without the Plan. The Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the Plan would not place a significant burden on competition for trading services.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A9kE" NAME="fr_A9kE">2801</a> The Commission also examined the effect of the funding model on competition in the market for trading services, including off-exchange liquidity suppliers and ATSs. In addition, the Commission considered the effect of implementation and ongoing costs of the Plan, whether particular elements of the Plan could hinder competition, and the effect of enhanced surveillance on competition in the market for trading services. The Commission recognized the risk that the Plan would have negative effects on competition and increase the barriers to entry in this market, but discussed how the Plan provisions and Commission oversight could mitigate these risks.</p>
          <p id="de717076-546b-44a5-b61b-56a7ccae2bdd">The Commission discussed how the market for trading services&#8212;which is served by exchanges, ATSs, and liquidity providers (internalizers and others) &#8212;relies on competition to supply investors with execution services at efficient prices. These trading venues, which compete to match traders with counterparties, provide a framework for price negotiation and disseminating trading information. The Commission observed that, since the adoption of Regulation NMS in 2005, there has been a shift in the market share of trading volume among trading venues. From 2005 to 2013, there was an increase in the market share of newer national securities exchanges and a decline in market share on NYSE. In addition, the proportion of NMS Stocks trading off-exchange (which includes both internalization and ATS trading) increased.</p>
          <p id="cb020bec-d23f-450b-9bd0-32beb91a4e72">The Commission noted that the Plan examines the effect of the CAT NMS Plan on the market for trading services primarily from the perspective of the exchanges. The Plan asserts that distribution of regulatory costs incurred by the Plan would be distributed according to &#8220;the Plan&#8217;s funding principles,&#8221; calibrated to avoid placing &#8220;undue burden on exchanges relative to their core characteristics,&#8221; and would thus not cause any exchange to be at a relative &#8220;competitive disadvantage in a way that would materially impact the respective Execution Venue marketplaces.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz237-4" NAME="fr_pz237-4">2802</a> Likewise, the Plan asserts that its method of cost allocation would avoid discouraging entry into the Participant community because a potential entrant, like an ATS, would &#8220;be assessed exactly the same amount [of allocated CAT-related fees] for a given level of activity&#8221; both before and after becoming an exchange.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz237-5" NAME="fr_pz237-5">2803</a></p>
          <p id="9d1ff2f9-659e-45ad-84fe-e58e78d40f48">In addition, in its final analysis described below, the Commission examines each of the issues in relation to competition in the market for trading services and revises its economic analysis in response to comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan.</p>
          <p id="2a2f13c4-f008-46df-95e7-9686910c705e">(1) Funding</p>
          <p id="5d81fd36-5ad1-4c42-bbdb-73ea70433bc1">The Commission noted that the Operating Committee will fund the Central Repository by allocating its costs across exchanges, FINRA, ATSs (&#8220;Execution Venues&#8221;) and broker-dealers (&#8220;Industry Members&#8221;), and will decide which proportion of costs would be funded by exchanges, FINRA, and ATSs and which portion would be funded by broker-dealers. The Commission observed that the Plan does not specify how the Operating Committee would select the method of allocation. The Commission believed that any impacts of such fees on competition in the market for trading services will manifest either through the model for the fees itself or through the later allocation of the fees across market participant types, across equity or options exchanges, or within market participant types and markets, through the levels of fees paid by each tier.</p>
          <p id="8045353a-fe50-4bc8-989b-30685dc7c6fa">A. Funding Model</p>
          <p id="6b03db55-7b3f-46a9-83da-5ca1146433e1">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the structure of the funding model could provide a competitive advantage to exchanges.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAqcDO" NAME="fr_pAqcDO">2804</a> Specifically, the Commission noted that the Plan states that an entity would be assessed exactly the same amount for a given level of activity whether it acted as an ATS or an exchange. However, FINRA would be charged fees based on the market share of off-exchange trading. ATSs, which are FINRA members, would presumably pay a portion of the FINRA fee through their broker-dealer membership fees. In addition, ATSs would pay a fee for their market share, which is a portion of the total off-exchange market share. Therefore, ATS volume would effectively be charged once to the broker-dealer operating the ATS and a second time to FINRA, which would result in ATSs paying more than exchanges for the same level of activity. Ultimately, if the funding model disadvantages ATSs relative to exchanges, trading volume could migrate to exchanges in response, and ATSs could have incentives to register as exchanges as well. Additionally, the Commission discussed its belief that the Participation Fee<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz239-3" NAME="fr_pz239-3">2805</a> could discourage new exchange entrants or the registration of an ATS as an exchange, increasing the barriers to entry to becoming an exchange. However, the Commission also explained that because the funding model seems to charge ATSs more for their market share than exchanges, ATSs could pay relatively less for their market share as an exchange than as an ATS, countering this barrier to entry depending on the magnitudes of the two fee types.</p>
          <p id="4db6dfe3-5474-4166-af52-89984b848438">As described earlier,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz239-4" NAME="fr_pz239-4">2806</a> the Participants propose to amend the manner in which market share will be calculated for a national securities association that has trades reported by its members to its trade reporting facility or facilities for reporting transactions effected otherwise than on an exchange in NMS Stock or OTC Equity Securities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz239-5" NAME="fr_pz239-5">2807</a> For such an association, its market share for purposes of qualifying for a particular tier in the funding model would not include the share volume reported to the national securities association by an ATS, as such share volume will be included in the market share calculation for that ATS. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AsCX" NAME="fr_AsCX">2808</a> As discussed above in Section IV.F, the Commission is modifying the Plan as the Participants suggested.</p>
          <p id="fb76055e-ed3e-413e-98fc-e772d18dbedb">This modification reduces the potential for the Plan to charge ATSs more than similarly situated exchanges, but it may not alleviate all the fee differentials between ATSs and exchanges. As described above, <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz240-4" NAME="fr_pz240-4">2809</a> these fee differentials may arise because message traffic to and from an ATS would generate fee obligations on the broker-dealer that sponsors the ATS, while exchanges incur almost no message traffic fees. Even with this modification, the Commission continues to believe that the Funding Model could provide a competitive advantage to exchanges over ATSs. However, the Commission is approving the Plan without further modification for the reasons discussed in <a href="#2777010b-4836-49b2-b02a-964fdd0c6000">Section IV.F</a>, above.</p>
          <p id="d8903593-69a3-4c5e-bb02-458eb0ae5f1b">B. Allocation of Voting Rights and Fees</p>
          <p id="fe6abc4b-9755-4eea-a6c1-9cee2b8b7aac">In the Notice, the Commission recognized that the potential for a burden on competition and effects on competitors in the market for trading services could arise from provisions relating to the allocation and exercise of voting rights.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz240-5" NAME="fr_pz240-5">2810</a> The Commission noted that the potential for concentration of influence over vote outcomes arises from proposed provisions to give one vote to each Plan Participant in an environment where some Participants are Affiliated SROs. Indeed, supermajority approval could be achieved through four of the 10 groups of Affiliated SROs and individual SROs, and majority approval could be achieved with just three such groups or individual SROs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz240-6" NAME="fr_pz240-6">2811</a> For example, the Participant groups with options exchanges could have the incentive to allocate a disproportionately low level of fees for options market share than for equity market share. The Commission noted that such an allocation could disadvantage competing Participants with only equities exchanges.</p>
          <p id="15304c5e-25d5-4313-ae32-740c8011ce3a">The Commission also noted that the inclusion of all exchanges on the Operating Committee could give the Plan Participants opportunities and incentives to share information and coordinate strategies in ways that could reduce the competition among exchanges or could create a competitive advantage for exchanges over venues for off-exchange trading.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz241-4" NAME="fr_pz241-4">2812</a> However, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that certain provisions of the Plan would limit these potential burdens on competition. In particular, the Plan includes provisions designed to limit the flow of information between the employees of the Plan Participants who serve as members of the Operating Committee and other employees of the Plan Participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz241-5" NAME="fr_pz241-5">2813</a></p>
          <p id="9d95bfec-c727-40b3-ba06-92fc17e60244">Additionally, the Commission agreed with the Plan&#8217;s assessment that some governance features of the Plan will limit adverse effects on competition in the market for trading services. These include provisions limiting the incentive and ability of Operating Committee members to serve the private interests of their employers, such as the rules regulating conflicts of interest. Moreover, the Commission explained that it may summarily abrogate and require the filing of Plan amendments that establish or change a fee in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608(a)(1)</a> and review such amendments in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3fd895e35ee3ddfd20985c442b3ec7d4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se17.4.242_1608&amp;rgn=div8">Rule 608(b)(2) of Regulation NMS</a>, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-3" NAME="fr_pz242-3">2814</a> In such a case, if the Commission chooses to approve such amendment, it would be by order and with such changes or subject to such conditions as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz242-4" NAME="fr_pz242-4">2815</a></p>
          <p id="cb32e394-e8d4-4c06-a3ae-e032719f3dd2">Several commenters provided information relevant to the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the potential impact of the allocation of fees on competition. In particular, three commenters suggested that there was an inherent conflict of interest as the SROs were the only ones with votes, yet will be involved in the decision to allocate funding responsibility across SROs and broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-3" NAME="fr_pz243-3">2816</a> Such comments relate to the influence of voting rights on the allocation of fees to exchanges (SROs) compared to ATSs and internalizers (broker-dealers). The Commission notes also that certain EMSAC discussions recognized conflicts in the market for trading services.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-4" NAME="fr_pz243-4">2817</a></p>
          <p id="e3458e1a-1a81-499a-b7f0-fb697fad4368">The Commission believes that the concerns expressed in the comments and the EMSAC discussions are consistent with the Commission&#8217;s discussion and analysis of the potential impacts in the Notice. The Commission recognized in the Notice that bloc voting could create a competitive advantage for exchanges over trading venues for off-exchange trading. The commenters did not address the Commission&#8217;s discussion in the Notice of certain provisions in the Plan that would limit potential burdens on competition or of the role of the Commission in approving NMS Plan fee filings. The Commission notes that changes in the number of exchanges and in exchange groups since the Notice <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-5" NAME="fr_pz243-5">2818</a> affect the potential influence of bloc voting because fewer SRO groups will be needed for approval or to block an approval.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz243-6" NAME="fr_pz243-6">2819</a> Nonetheless, the Commission continues to believe that provisions in the Plan and Commission oversight of the allocation of fees could mitigate these concerns.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz244-7" NAME="fr_pz244-7">2820</a></p>
          <p id="8d2126fc-01f2-467b-841c-f456d5df6bd1">(2) Costs of Compliance</p>
          <p id="677db148-c971-4fba-b686-f13f8acb1c0c">In the Notice, the Commission explained that because all Participants but one compete in the market for trading services, the ability of affiliates to vote as a group could in principle allow a few large Participant groups to influence the outcome of competition in the market for trading services by making various decisions that can alter the costs of one set of competitors more than another set.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz244-8" NAME="fr_pz244-8">2821</a> In addition, the Commission discussed the fact that the Plan calls for profits to be distributed equally among Participants, which could advantage smaller exchanges during profitable years and disadvantage smaller exchanges during loss years.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz244-9" NAME="fr_pz244-9">2822</a></p>
          <p id="be9b0cec-8e1d-4ed8-8b80-7a4985494fb3">The Commission explained that generally, smaller competitors could have implementation and ongoing costs of compliance that are disproportionate relative to their size. It noted that, to lessen the impact of funding the Central Repository on smaller exchanges and ATSs, the Plan would apply a tiered funding model that charges the smallest exchanges and ATSs the lowest fees. Likewise, the Plan would apply a tiered funding model that would charge the smallest broker-dealers, including liquidity suppliers, the lowest fees. However, the Commission noted that the Plan does not indicate whether off-exchange liquidity providers would pay fees similar to similarly-sized ATSs and exchanges. This is important because, as described earlier, broker-dealers internalizing orders off exchanges would only be allocated fees based on message traffic, whereas orders routed to ATSs and exchanges lead to broker-dealer fees based on message traffic and ATS or exchange fees based on market share. If these fees are even partially passed on to customers, then the cost differentials that result might create incentives for broker-dealers to route order flow to those broker-dealers who internalize in order to minimize costs, creating a potential conflict of interest with broker-dealers&#8217; investor customers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAxCM" NAME="fr_pAxCM">2823</a></p>
          <p id="b15978e3-bcb9-417a-9ed0-473e5f65a79f">The Commission discussed the fact that the Plan provides that the Technical Specifications will not be finalized until after the selection of a Plan Processor, which will not occur until after any decision by the Commission to approve the Plan. The Commission recognized that the costs of compliance associated with future technical choices or the selection of the Plan Processor could exacerbate the relative cost differential across competitors. However, the Commission preliminarily believed that the governance provisions of the Plan and Commission oversight could help to mitigate such effects in the market for trading services.</p>
          <p id="01325db6-35ca-41e5-ae78-6ef60a2c9be1">The Commission received several comments relevant to its analysis of the potential impact of the costs of compliance on competition in the market for trading services.

This increase in profits could encourage new entrants or could spark greater competition, which would reduce transaction costs for investors. For example, if the Plan facilitates surveillance improvements that deter spoofing, the Commission stated that it could increase incentives to provide liquidity and promote lower transaction costs for investors, particularly in stocks that may lack a critical mass of competing liquidity providers or that could be targets for violative trading behavior.</p>
          <p id="1ccfa4b7-376f-4923-a494-ed82922f73ac">The Commission did not receive comments related to its economic analysis on enhanced surveillance and deterrence of violative behavior affecting competition in the market for trading services.

The Commission also noted that broker-dealers that outsource regulatory data reporting activities are expected to see their costs of regulatory data reporting increase, while broker-dealers that insource may see a decrease in their regulatory data reporting costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A-Am" NAME="fr_A-Am">2833</a> The Commission stated that it preliminarily believed this dynamic might affect competition between Outsourcers (that tend to be smaller) and Insourcers (that tend to be larger), and might increase barriers to entry in some segments of this market.</p>
          <p id="882b6ef4-e3d5-4316-b468-d1f0190cc6ee">The Notice discussed the Plan&#8217;s assertion that it will have little to no adverse effect on competition between large broker-dealers, and will not materially disadvantage small broker-dealers relative to large broker-dealers. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz249-3" NAME="fr_pz249-3">2834</a> Regarding small broker-dealers, the Plan states, &#8220;&#8230;. [the allocation of costs to broker-dealers based on their contribution to market activity] may be significant for some small firms, and may even impact their business models materially . . . .&#8221; and that the Participants were sensitive to the burdens the Plan could impose on small broker-dealers, noting that such broker-dealers could incur minimal costs under their existing regulatory reporting requirements &#8220;because they are OATS-exempt or excluded broker-dealers or limited purpose broker-dealers.&#8221; The Commission noted that the CAT NMS Plan attempts to mitigate its impact on these broker-dealers by proposing to follow a cost allocation formula that should charge lower fees to smaller broker-dealers;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz249-4" NAME="fr_pz249-4">2835</a> furthermore, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> provides them additional time to commence their reporting requirements.</p>
          <p id="daa0e067-0abf-4514-beac-ef4bf43f4f6a">The Commission preliminarily agreed with the Plan&#8217;s general assessment of competition among broker-dealers, and also with the Plan&#8217;s assessment of differential effects on small versus large broker-dealers. The Commission agreed that the Plan&#8217;s funding model was an explicit source of financial obligation for broker-dealers and therefore an important feature to evaluate when considering potential differential effects of the Plan on competition in the market for broker-dealers. However, the Commission preliminarily believed that the segments of the market most likely to experience higher barriers to entry are those that currently have no data reporting requirements of the type the Plan requires and those that will involve more CAT Reporting obligations, such as the part of the broker-dealer market that involves connecting to exchanges, because of the technology infrastructure requirements and the potential to have to report several types of order events. Nonetheless, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that any increases in the barriers to entry are justified because they are necessary in order for the CAT Data to include data from small broker-dealers. Specifically, the Commission noted that excluding small broker-dealers from reporting requirements would eliminate the collection of audit trail information from a segment of the broker-dealer community and would thus result in an audit trail that does not capture all orders by all participants in the securities markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz250-4" NAME="fr_pz250-4">2836</a></p>
          <p id="75cef255-db7f-4bc9-b0c8-5f080d1222f2">The Commission also recognized that the Plan could affect the current relative competitive positions of broker-dealers in the market for broker-dealer services because the economic impacts resulting from the Plan could benefit some broker-dealers and adversely affect others. However, the Commission stated that there is no clear reason to expect these impacts, should they occur, to decrease the current state of overall competition in the market for broker-dealer services so as to materially burden the price or quality of services received by investors on average.</p>
          <p id="483688aa-7f18-4dbb-b8b2-8ee7f004a74a">Regardless of the differential effects of the CAT NMS Plan on small versus large broker-dealers, the Commission discussed in the Notice that its preliminary view was that the CAT NMS Plan, in aggregate, will likely not reduce competition and efficiency in the overall market for broker-dealer services. The Commission explained that even if small broker-dealers potentially face a burden, this may not necessarily have an adverse effect on competition as a whole in the overall market for broker-dealer services. Under the Plan, broker-dealers could face high upfront costs to set up a processing environment to meet reporting responsibilities. As upfront, fixed costs, the burden could be greater for small broker-dealers. Instead of bearing these costs in-house, small broker-dealers could contract with outside vendors, which could lead to lower costs relative to not using a vendor for reporting services. Thus, the Commission explained that even firms that currently do not report to OATS, but will be CAT Reporters under the Plan, could face manageable upfront costs that permit them to continue in their line of business without a severe setback in their profitability.</p>
          <p id="566e33a5-5937-4031-b177-0e2304ccc72b">The Commission noted that a difficulty in assessing the likely impacts of the CAT NMS Plan on competition among broker-dealers is that competition in the markets for different broker-dealer services could be affected in different ways. If CAT costs represent a significant increase in overall business costs, the Plan could disadvantage broker-dealers who are CAT Reporters in the market segments that do not require CAT reporting. For example, broker-dealers that, in addition to providing services related to market transactions that are reportable to CAT, also compete to provide fixed-income order entry as a line of business may be at a relative disadvantage to competitors in the fixed-income market who do not provide broker-dealer services that are related to market activity that is reportable to CAT.</p>
          <p id="9a847f06-e4b0-4c10-af65-81bdf3409065">The Commission recognized that the CAT NMS Plan could result in fewer broker-dealers providing specialized services that trigger CAT reporting obligations. The Commission also recognized, however, that fewer broker-dealers in a specialized segment of the market may not necessarily harm competition in that segment. In particular, the CAT compliance costs may be less of a relative burden for large broker-dealers who may provide a larger portfolio of specialized services to clients. This portfolio may buffer large broker-dealers from business risk associated with specialization, and so large broker-dealers are likely to maintain their presence in specialized market segments. If a sufficient number of large broker-dealers maintain their presence in specialized market segments, a net decrease in broker-dealers may not affect the competition in such market segments to a level in which the market segment offers fewer or lower quality services or higher prices.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-3" NAME="fr_pz2-3">2837</a> However, the Commission recognized that negative effects on competition in specialized market segments could result if broker-dealers achieve a level of market concentration necessary to adversely affect prices for investors.</p>
          <p id="555f8b20-5713-4bb9-8a9c-6e138fdb6194">The Commission received a few comment letters regarding its analysis of the effect of the Plan on the market for broker-dealer services. As previously described,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-4" NAME="fr_pz2-4">2838</a> the Commission received one comment that noted that message traffic tiers could place a larger burden on market makers of liquid securities and a lower burden on liquidity takers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-5" NAME="fr_pz2-5">2839</a> In addition, one commenter noted that the current phased implementation schedule poses risks to clearing firms who will have to support both large and small broker-dealers during CAT implementation, incurring more CAT implementation costs than broker-dealers that do not have introducing broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-6" NAME="fr_pz2-6">2840</a> Another comment estimated that CAT reporting costs, even at a $5,000 per month minimum, could reach 15% or more of revenue for a subset of small broker-dealers that are currently OATS exempt.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-7" NAME="fr_pz2-7">2841</a> The commenter further stated that the Plan would have the greatest proportionate burden for those firms, which have the smallest justification for regulatory concern<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz2-8" NAME="fr_pz2-8">2842</a> and expressed concern regarding the ability for certain firms to say in business, stating that the Plan would &#8220;destroy the business model and profitability&#8221; of such firms.</p>
          <p id="680a9173-7c73-43de-83cb-2ec25d71499c">The Participants&#8217; response letter addressed comments related to the market for broker-dealer services. With regards to the funding model tiers placing a larger burden on market makers of liquid securities, the Participants did not comment on the relative burden, but argued that a fixed-fee funding model would reduce the disincentives to provide liquidity to the market and would lead to fewer market distortions than a strictly variable funding model. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-4" NAME="fr_pz3-4">2843</a> With regards to the phased implementation schedule, the Participants noted that small broker-dealers may voluntarily begin reporting within two years instead of the required three years, <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-5" NAME="fr_pz3-5">2844</a> but did not address whether this poses risks for clearing firms supporting both large and small broker-dealers. The Participants also did not address the relative burden on OATS-exempt broker-dealers.</p>
          <p id="e79e86e1-5625-471e-8926-194e9ae0d555">In response to these comments, the Commission has revised its economic analysis of the effect of the Plan on the market for broker-dealer services. First, the Commission now recognizes the potential differential effect on those broker-dealers that engage in market making in liquid stocks versus illiquid stocks and on those broker-dealers that engage in liquidity taking strategies versus those that engage in other strategies. The Commission believes that this differential effect could result in broker-dealers altering their activities, which could have the second order effects described above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAJJ" NAME="fr_pAJJ">2845</a> and could change the level of competition in certain market segments, such as those that specialize in providing services in more liquid securities. However, the Commission believes that services in liquid securities is the most competitive segment in the broker-dealer industry and therefore, does not believe that effects on competition would be material. In particular, based on Commission Staff experience, the Commission understands that quote competition in liquid securities comes from market makers on many exchanges, over-the-counter market makers, and customers who post quotations. These securities trade on one penny spreads and have deep order books. Further, consistent with the Participants&#8217; Response Letter II, the tiered nature of the funding model effectively fixes the fees. In highly competitive markets, fixed fees should not affect prices. Therefore, the highly competitive liquid securities markets should remain liquid and highly competitive under the Plan, despite the fees related to message traffic.</p>
          <p id="549e702f-ce3b-4d42-8e12-5f42d730d964">The Commission also agrees with the comment that certain broker-dealers could face a disproportionately large burden of costs from reporting, even as high as 15% of revenue as the commenter noted, and already recognized this possibility in the economic analysis in the Notice. However, the Commission is not revising its conclusion that it is necessary for even the smallest broker-dealers to report to CAT. Specifically, the Commission believes that excluding certain broker-dealers from reporting requirements would result in an audit trail that does not capture all orders by all participants in the securities markets, which could incentivize prospective wrongdoers to utilize these firms to evade regulatory oversight.</p>
          <p id="dfd41eb2-5583-4502-ad79-15bbd0a53352">With regards to competition, the Commission continues to believe that even if regulatory burdens from CAT reduce the number of small broker-dealers in specialized segments, overall competition in those segments may not be harmed.</p>
          <p id="6e40455b-c51c-4e99-a067-d5383c8acdf5">With regards to the comment on relative costs for clearing firms supporting large and small brokers during CAT implementation, the Commission acknowledges the costs of reporting to duplicative systems, and the relatively high costs to introducing broker-dealers. However, it is not clear why the additional costs to clearing firms servicing other broker-dealers would not be passed along to small broker-dealers&#8212;the impact of which has already been discussed. As such, the Commission does not believe the impact on clearing firms due to the phased implementation schedule is sufficiently large to affect competition in this market, and is not changing the Economic Analysis as it relates to costs for clearing services.</p>
          <p id="32581673-8e1c-475b-91e7-91fd86bbd1ea">The Commission does not believe that the modifications to the funding model described above will affect the allocation of fees or the relative compliance costs among broker-dealers. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz5-6" NAME="fr_pz5-6">2846</a> Overall, the Commission continues to believe that the CAT NMS Plan, in aggregate, would likely not reduce competition and efficiency in the overall market for broker-dealer services. Even if small broker-dealers, broker-dealers of liquid securities, or clearing firms of large and small broker-dealers potentially face a relatively high burden, this may not necessarily have an adverse effect on competition as a whole in the overall market for broker-dealer services, as the Commission explained in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="a62c0bb2-4ba8-4005-a1b1-5c85af6f0276">c. Market for Regulatory Services</p>
          <p id="62ccce1d-f6c9-42b6-8b24-1487f5611605">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary conclusion that the Plan could provide opportunities for increased competition in the market to provide regulatory services.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAX4" NAME="fr_pAX4">2847</a> The Commission noted that SROs compete to provide regulatory services in at least two ways. First, because SROs are responsible for regulating trading within venues they operate, their regulatory services are bundled with their operation of the venue. Consequently, for a broker-dealer, selecting a trading venue also entails the selection of a provider of regulatory services surrounding the trading activity. Second, SROs could provide this supervision not only for their own trading venues, but for other SROs&#8217; trading venues as well through the use of Regulatory Service Agreements or a plan approved pursuant to <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9f68a8e7a7b905987c1fe94445a762b9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_117d_62">Rule 17d-2</a> under the Exchange Act.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-3" NAME="fr_pz6-3">2848</a> Consequently, SROs compete to provide regulatory services to trading venues they do not operate. The market for regulatory services in the equity and options markets currently has one dominant competitor, FINRA.</p>
          <p id="2d311f42-a3cb-477d-8606-b55f77338e70">In the Notice, the Commission noted that under the Plan, designated regulatory Staff from all of the SROs would have access to CAT Data, which would reduce the differences in data access across SROs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-4" NAME="fr_pz6-4">2849</a> This in turn could reduce barriers to entry in providing regulatory services because data will be centralized and standardized, possibly reducing economies of scale in performing surveillance activities. Furthermore, because some types of previously infeasible surveillance will become possible with the availability of additional data, the Commission believes that SROs will have greater opportunities to innovate in the type of surveillance that is performed, and the efficiency with which it is performed. In addition, as <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)(3)(iv)</a> requires, SROs will implement new or updated surveillance within 14 months after effectiveness of the CAT NMS Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-11" NAME="fr_pz6-11">2850</a> and thus any SRO could reconsider its approach to outsourcing its regulatory services and whether it wants to compete to provide regulatory services to others.</p>
          <p id="28d82e25-9015-4382-b098-4b30e984eb4d">While the Commission did not receive any comments addressing the effects of the CAT NMS Plan on the market for regulatory services, nor was the issue addressed in the Participants&#8217; response, the Commission believes that certain EMSAC discussions are relevant to its analysis of competition in the market for regulatory services. In particular, the discussions regarding the EMSAC draft recommendation that the Commission should formalize by Rule the centralization of common regulatory functions across SROs into a single regulator reveal other potential considerations. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-3" NAME="fr_pz7-3">2851</a> In particular, the EMSAC subcommittee on Trading Venues opined that some regulatory activities are duplicative and needlessly complex because they are dispersed across SROs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-4" NAME="fr_pz7-4">2852</a> Further, the subcommittee argued that CAT will increase that duplicative regulatory oversight. In response to the EMSAC discussions, one commenter pointed out benefits in having competition between regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-5" NAME="fr_pz7-5">2853</a> This commenter explained that CAT Data could open up new frontiers for regulation that competition between multiple SROs could leverage off of.</p>
          <p id="c6c21757-3f84-450b-ba6d-2d443a03533f">The Commission recognizes that increased competition in the market for regulatory services could create duplication of regulations, as the EMSAC discussed. But, ultimately, the Commission&#8217;s conclusions related to competition&#8212;namely, that the Plan will provide opportunities for increased competition in the market to provide regulatory services&#8212;are unchanged from the Notice. The Commission recognizes, however, the uncertainty of whether EMSAC will make a formal recommendation to the Commission and whether and how the Commission would act with respect to such a recommendation.</p>

          <p id="9b5fbbf3-75b9-4568-b59e-5e6228658bed">In the Notice, the Commission analyzed the effect of the CAT NMS Plan on competition in the market for data reporting services with a focus on its impact on the costs incurred by broker-dealers to comply with the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-6" NAME="fr_pz8-6">2854</a> As discussed in the Costs section above, the Commission preliminarily believed that many broker-dealers, particularly smaller broker-dealers, would fulfill their CAT reporting obligations by outsourcing to service bureaus and that the fees charged by the service bureaus would be a major cost driver for these broker-dealers. Further, these fees would factor into the increase in barriers to entry in the market for broker-dealer services.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-7" NAME="fr_pz8-7">2855</a> Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believed that any effects on competition in the market for regulatory data reporting services could have a significant effect on the costs incurred by broker-dealers in complying with the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
          <p id="5e3b8e56-86d0-471f-ab6e-dea491f08d4b">The Plan provided information on broker-dealers&#8217; use of third-party service providers to accomplish current regulatory data reporting. The Plan noted that while some broker-dealers perform their regulatory data reporting in-house, others outsource this activity. As noted in the Costs section of the Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgnY" NAME="fr_pAgnY">2856</a> the Commission understands that most firms outsource the bulk of their regulatory data reporting to third-party firms. The Commission preliminarily believed that the competition in the market to provide data reporting services is a product of firms choosing to perform this activity in-house or to outsource it based on a number of considerations including cost, with some firms choosing to outsource this activity across multiple service providers.</p>
          <p id="dcd16b25-0571-4f54-a383-0d138fcb4801">The market for regulatory data reporting services is currently characterized by bundling, high switching costs, and barriers to entry. First, service bureaus often bundle regulatory data reporting services with an order-handling system service that provides broker-dealers with market access and order routing capabilities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-4" NAME="fr_pz9-4">2857</a> Additionally, they sometimes bundle regulatory data reporting services with trade clearing services. Second, switching costs for service bureaus may be high and involve complex onboarding processes and requirements. Furthermore, systems between service bureaus may be disparate, and switching service providers may require different or updated client documentation. Difficulty switching between service providers could limit the competition among service bureaus to provide data reporting services, and impact the costs that Outsourcers incur to secure regulatory data reporting services. Third, high information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) infrastructure costs also give rise to barriers to entry, which could slow the entry of new market participants into this market. Despite this, the Commission explained that based on information from broker-dealer discussions arranged by Financial Information Forum it preliminarily believed that the market for regulatory data reporting services is generally expanding and the trend is for more, not less, outsourcing.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAfx" NAME="fr_pAfx">2858</a></p>
          <p id="14f02554-8ea9-4d25-a44a-2c46d2bfa002">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the Plan could alter the competitive landscape in the market for data reporting services in several ways. First, the Plan could increase the demand for data reporting services by requiring reporting by broker-dealers that may have previously been exempt due to size under individual SRO rules.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ALY" NAME="fr_ALY">2859</a> Because more broker-dealers would be required to report regulatory data under the Plan, the Commission preliminarily believed there could be an opportunity for increased competition in this market which might benefit all Outsourcers by reducing costs or increasing innovation. However, the increase in demand for data reporting services could serve to entrench existing providers if they capture a large share of newly created demand; this could lead to relatively higher costs for broker-dealers than they would face in a more competitive market. The potential increase in demand for data reporting services also could impact the capacity of already existing service providers to meet this increase in demand, and this in turn could have implications for competition and pricing in the market for data reporting services. Considering the barriers to entry that characterize the market for data reporting services and this potential increase in demand, service bureaus could have less incentive to compete for broker-dealer clients because these clients are no longer scarce, and as such, the CAT NMS Plan could result in a decline in the competition for data reporting services. It is possible that broker-dealers seeking to establish relationships with service bureaus could have trouble securing them because of the need to on-board many broker-dealers at once, especially if the service bureaus have limited on-boarding capacity. In the short-run these capacity constraints and the high demand could increase the costs of reporting through a service bureau. However, the two year implementation period for large broker-dealers and three year period for small broker-dealers could alleviate the reduction in competition due to the onboarding capacity strain because current service bureaus have time to increase their on-boarding capacity and new entrants have time to build the necessary IT infrastructure and a client base.</p>
          <p id="57cab747-ae5f-4ae8-ba75-58e90d585a9f">Second, the Commission discussed in the Notice how the CAT NMS Plan could dramatically change the pool of firms demanding data reporting services, which would be skewed toward firms that are smaller and on average costlier to service, which could result in higher prices that could eventually be passed onto investors. In addition to small and medium sized broker-dealers that previously self-reported data to SROs, who now would be required to report, the CAT NMS Plan would also result in other broker-dealers having data reporting responsibilities. The Commission preliminarily believed that these broker-dealers would predominantly be small. Because the Plan would require additional elements in regulatory data, particularly customer data, some broker-dealers that currently self-report could no longer find it economically feasible to do so.</p>
          <p id="2b131201-4ca4-4099-b0a8-4f830652b884">Third, in addition to possibly increasing demand for data reporting services, the Commission discussed how the CAT NMS Plan may have a mixed effect on the number of firms offering data reporting services. This could impact the competitiveness of this market, and affect the costs broker-dealers bear in securing these services. On one hand, the number of firms offering data reporting services could decrease, because the need to secure PII might increase the likelihood of liability and litigation risks in the event of a security breach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz11-4" NAME="fr_pz11-4">2860</a> On the other hand, it is possible that the number of service bureaus offering data reporting services would increase. New reporting requirements for broker-dealers could create opportunities for new entrants to meet this demand. This could increase capacity and result in innovation in providing these services, which could benefit broker-dealers needing data reporting services by potentially reducing reporting costs, or at least reducing the potential for cost increases. Lower reporting costs for broker-dealers could in turn benefit the investors who are serviced by these broker-dealers, through reduced costs.</p>
          <p id="8ee770da-a93e-445b-9fa4-a93d8efc310c">Fourth, the Commission discussed how the Plan could decrease the demand for data reporting services. Many broker-dealers currently pay service bureaus to fulfill their regulatory data reporting; this may be because these broker-dealers find it would be more expensive to handle the translation of their order management system data into fixed formats, such as is required for OATS. If the Plan Processor allows broker-dealers to send data to the Central Repository in the formats that they use for normal operations, in drop copies for example, these broker-dealers may no longer see a cost advantage in engaging the services of a regulatory data reporting service provider because one of the costs associated with regulatory data reporting&#8212;having to translate data into a fixed format&#8212;will have been eliminated.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz12-4" NAME="fr_pz12-4">2861</a> These broker-dealers may then choose to insource their regulatory data reporting.</p>
          <p id="903bce3e-28cd-4d4d-a526-e8844332a5e9">The Commission preliminarily believed that this reduction in demand would not likely be realized and, if realized, would be unlikely to offset the increase in demand that would come from CAT reporters not currently subject to OATS reporting, who would now have reporting obligations. As noted in the Costs section of the Plan, of the 1,800 expected CAT Reporters, 868 do not currently report to OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz13-3" NAME="fr_pz13-3">2862</a> This meant that the Commission expected a large proportion of CAT Reporters may be broker-dealers that currently do not have a service bureau for regulatory data reporting but would choose to engage one to manage their CAT reporting responsibilities. This is more than the Commission&#8217;s estimate of 806 current outsourcing broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AqNu" NAME="fr_AqNu">2863</a> The Commission therefore noted that it is unlikely that the number of current Outsourcers that choose to become Insourcers would be larger than the number of non-OATS reporters that would elect to outsource. As a result, demand is more likely to increase. Further, the Commission explained that the proposed requirement for CAT reports to use listing exchange symbology could require pre-report data processing even if the Plan Processor allows for the receipt of reports in the formats that broker-dealers use for normal operations. As a result, the Commission explained that the CAT NMS Plan is unlikely to eliminate the costs of processing data prior to reporting that data to the Central Repository.</p>
          <p id="d13e7c0f-5839-496c-9c58-8b1f8e5b04c4">The Commission continues to believe that it is possible that the Plan would increase the demand for data reporting services by requiring regulatory data reporting by broker-dealers that may have previously been exempt due to size under individual SRO rules. Furthermore, the Commission continues to believe that the CAT NMS Plan may have a mixed effect on the number of firms offering data reporting services; this could impact the competitiveness of this market, and affect the costs broker-dealers bear in securing these services. Commenters did not provide any additional information or analysis that the Commission believes would warrant changes to its analysis or conclusions as set out in the Notice, nor does the Commission believe that the modifications to the Plan warrant changes to this aspect of the economic analysis.</p>

The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the Plan would likely result in significant improvements in efficiency related to how regulatory data is collected and used. The Commission also explained that the Plan could result in improvements in market efficiency by deterring violative activity. However, the Commission noted that any potential gains to efficiency from the retirement of duplicative and outdated reporting systems would be delayed for up to two and a half years and the interim period of increased duplicative reporting would impose significant financial burden on Industry Members.</p>
          <p id="fcaa3232-ec91-42d7-bc46-a68de4555994">Overall, after considering comments, Participants&#8217; responses, and modifications to the Plan, the Commission is updating and revising its economic analysis on efficiency. However, the revisions in the analysis do not impact the Commission&#8217;s broad conclusions. The Commission continues to believe that the Plan will generally improve the efficiency of regulatory activities and promote market efficiency.</p>
          <p id="906af33e-6226-49b1-b54d-7cad7fde9e55">a. Effect of the Plan on Efficiency</p>
          <p id="fcab6be8-3556-405a-b81c-4f1d6843b16e">Building off the discussion in the Plan, in the Notice, the Commission analyzed the effect of the Plan on the efficiency of detecting violative behavior through examinations and enforcement, on the efficiency of surveillance, on market efficiency through deterrence of violative behavior, on operational efficiency of CAT Reporters, and on efficiencies through reduced ad hoc data requests and quicker access to data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz15-5" NAME="fr_pz15-5">2865</a></p>
          <p id="aa637639-18fb-434a-a1fc-0ccd619b21be">The Commission explained that currently, regulators&#8217; ability to efficiently supervise and surveil market participants and carry out their enforcement responsibilities is hindered by limitations in regulatory data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz15-6" NAME="fr_pz15-6">2866</a> Second, regulators&#8217; ability to efficiently perform cross-market surveillance is also hindered by limitations in regulatory data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz15-7" NAME="fr_pz15-7">2867</a> Finally, there are a number of other inefficiencies associated with the current system of regulatory data collection. These include: delays in data availability to regulators; lack of direct access to data collected by other regulators results in numerous ad-hoc data requests; and the need for regulatory Staff to invest significant time and resources to reconciling disparate data sources.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz15-8" NAME="fr_pz15-8">2868</a></p>
          <p id="4f50891c-8dc3-4cd8-95d4-b9625282bd7d">The Plan discussed a number of expected effects on efficiency such as: monitoring for rule violations; performing surveillance; and supporting fewer reporting systems. The Commission preliminarily agreed with the Plan&#8217;s assessments of the expected effects, and in addition, the Commission discussed how the Plan could also reduce violative behavior.</p>
          <p id="2d3f8291-0166-49f2-9a9e-ea5ee3ef9fd1">First, the Plan concluded that SROs would experience improved efficiency in the detection of rule violations, particularly for violations that involve trading in multiple markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-3" NAME="fr_pz16-3">2869</a> The Plan stated an expectation that SROs would need to expend fewer resources to detect violative cross-market activity, and such activity would be detected more quickly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-4" NAME="fr_pz16-4">2870</a> The Commission preliminarily agreed that the Plan would result in improvements in efficiency in the performance of examinations of market participants by SROs and the Commission. Improvements to data availability and access through the Central Repository could allow SROs and the Commission to more efficiently identify market participants for examination.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-5" NAME="fr_pz16-5">2871</a> The Commission also agreed that the Plan would improve the efficiency of enforcement investigations. If regulatory data access improves, the quality and quantity of enforcement investigations could increase through improvements to the comprehensiveness and timeliness of data used to support investigations.</p>
          <p id="bf018f8e-d797-422f-8a65-44dfed4ead92">Second, the Plan stated that the Participants believe that the CAT NMS Plan could improve the efficiency of surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-6" NAME="fr_pz16-6">2872</a> This improvement is due to a number of factors including: increased surveillance capacity; improved system speed, which would result in more efficient data analysis; and a reduction in surveillance system downtime.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz16-7" NAME="fr_pz16-7">2873</a> The Plan also cited reduced monitoring costs,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-4" NAME="fr_pz17-4">2874</a> but the Commission noted that estimates in the Costs section of the Plan predicted increased surveillance costs if the Plan is approved. The increased surveillance costs predicted in the Plan could reflect more effective surveillance. Although the Plan did not discuss the cost-benefit tradeoff of increased surveillance directly, the Commission noted that achieving the level of surveillance that would be possible if the Plan is approved would likely be more expensive using currently available data sources, if it is achievable at all, due to the inefficiencies that currently exist in delivering regulatory supervision, which are discussed previously.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-5" NAME="fr_pz17-5">2875</a></p>
          <p id="412514ae-f7a4-408a-8b62-cac323f5850b">Third, the Plan also discussed increased efficiency due to the reduction in redundant reporting systems,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz17-6" NAME="fr_pz17-6">2876</a> specifically increases in system standardization, which would allow consolidation of resources, including the sunsetting of legacy reporting systems and processes, as well as consolidated data processing envisioned from the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAPy2Z" NAME="fr_pAPy2Z">2877</a> However, the Commission noted that it is aware that the Plan calls for a period of years during which Industry Members would face duplicative reporting systems before older regulatory data reporting systems are retired.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-4" NAME="fr_pz18-4">2878</a> This period of duplicative reporting would impose a considerable financial burden on Industry Members.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-5" NAME="fr_pz18-5">2879</a></p>
          <p id="27754e9a-339f-430e-99ff-20cc7379a1e3">The Plan also discussed two other possible efficiency improvements: a reduction in ad-hoc data requests and more fulsome access to raw data. While the Plan anticipated a decrease in ad-hoc data requests as a result of Plan-related data improvements, the Commission noted some types of ad-hoc data requests, such as, data requests for later-stage investigations might increase.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-6" NAME="fr_pz18-6">2880</a> The Commission recognized that these increases in data requests would partially offset the efficiency improvements from the reduction in data requests noted above, but the Commission preliminarily believed that the Plan would reduce the total number of data requests.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-7" NAME="fr_pz18-7">2881</a> Furthermore, the Plan anticipated more robust access to unprocessed regulatory data, which could improve the efficiency with which SROs and the Commission could respond to market events where they previously had to submit data requests and wait for data validation procedures to be completed before accessing data collected by other regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz18-8" NAME="fr_pz18-8">2882</a></p>
          <p id="1e8463b7-3e6c-4b67-9f9b-6eb23922df62">In addition to the potential benefits to efficiency discussed in the Plan, the Commission also discussed that CAT may reduce violative behavior. Improvements in the efficiency of market surveillance, investigations, and enforcement could directly reduce the amount of violative behavior by identifying and penalizing market participants who violate rules and who would more easily go undetected in the current regime. Furthermore, market participants&#8217; awareness regarding improvements in the efficiency of market surveillance, investigations, and enforcement (or perceptions thereof), and the resultant increase in the probability of incurring a costly penalty for violative behavior, could deter violative behavior.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz19-4" NAME="fr_pz19-4">2883</a> Reductions in violative behavior through both of these economic channels could improve market efficiency.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz19-5" NAME="fr_pz19-5">2884</a></p>
          <p id="6203d980-44a6-42e8-9545-8a2af7e239a5">The Commission received a comment on the cost estimates of the CAT NMS Plan and its effects on increasing the efficiency of surveillance activities. The commenter agreed with the Commission&#8217;s findings that the estimate of total implementation cost was accurate, however, the commenter stated that it is implausible that CAT would reduce surveillance costs by more than 40% while simultaneously improving the effectiveness of surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz19-6" NAME="fr_pz19-6">2885</a></p>
          <p id="639931fc-128a-4c53-a24c-d4c6c17ee3e3">The Commission also received a comment on whether the CAT NMS Plan would increase the efficiency in detecting rule violations and subsequent gains to market efficiency due to the reduction in violative behavior.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAd6z" NAME="fr_pAd6z">2886</a> The commenter disagreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the Plan&#8217;s effect on market efficiency due to the reductions in violative behavior, arguing that effectively and efficiently deterring violative behavior should be done by using a system other than the CAT, preferably the commenter&#8217;s proposed system which involves the use of real-time analytics.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-5" NAME="fr_pz20-5">2887</a></p>
          <p id="8384b168-1b05-4c99-8440-58aefc34ce81">The Commission also received numerous comments on whether the retirement of duplicative reporting systems and the reduction in ad-hoc data requests would generate gains to efficiency. One commenter disagreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the effect of the Plan on the reduction in duplicative reporting and ad-hoc requests.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-6" NAME="fr_pz20-6">2888</a> Three commenters indicated that the period of duplicative reporting could also reduce the expected benefits of CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-7" NAME="fr_pz20-7">2889</a> One of these commenters suggested that the Plan&#8217;s timeline for the retirement of duplicative reporting does not provide the SROs with sufficient incentives to migrate surveillances to CAT, implying that there could be a reduction in the efficiency of surveillance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-8" NAME="fr_pz20-8">2890</a> Another commenter emphasized the inherent complexities of dual reporting, and the impact that this would have on the efficiency and effectiveness of reporting during this period.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz20-9" NAME="fr_pz20-9">2891</a></p>
          <p id="d74a00e6-b9a3-46b5-9eb7-2692442aedab">While the Participants did not directly respond to comments regarding efficiency, they did state that they expect cost savings as a result of moving surveillance operations from existing systems to the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAze" NAME="fr_pAze">2892</a></p>
          <p id="03a7d18a-8678-4be6-bc87-597f914d6b5f">The Commission considered these comments, the Participants&#8217; response, and modifications to the Plan, and is revising its analysis of the inefficiencies associated with duplicative reporting. The Commission is not revising its analysis or conclusions with regard to other aspects of efficiency.</p>
          <p id="79f10353-03a2-4881-bfe9-042bca1f814b">First, the Commission disagrees with the commenter who raised concerns about the surveillance cost estimates. As discussed above, all 19 SROs<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz21-5" NAME="fr_pz21-5">2893</a> responded to the Participants Study regarding cost estimates, and most SROs have experience collecting audit trail data as well as expertise in their business practices. Furthermore, the commenter provided no reasoning or estimates to indicate that the Participants are unable to reasonably estimate their current data reporting costs, and the Participants&#8217; Response Letter II confirms the anticipated cost savings described in the Notice. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that the cost estimates in the Notice are accurate, and that the CAT NMS Plan would improve the efficiency of surveillance by fostering increased surveillance capacity; improved system speed, which would result in more efficient data analysis; and a reduction in surveillance downtime.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAtpP" NAME="fr_pAtpP">2894</a></p>
          <p id="afd6f4d7-7dc1-47cf-a65a-904d0cbb5234">Second, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that stated that the CAT Plan would not improve market efficiency due to reductions in violative behavior, and that the Plan should adopt real-time analytics. The Commission continues to believe that real-time analytics are not necessarily required to reduce violative behavior. Analysis of raw data on T+1 and corrected data after T+3 can reveal violative activity nonetheless.</p>
          <p id="fb473425-3e6e-471d-aa11-349768c63cbf">Third, regarding the commenter who seems to imply that the Commission attributes savings in surveillance costs solely to the reduction in ad-hoc data requests, which is not the case. As discussed in the Notice, the Commission believes that it is possible that Participants and the Commission could realize efficiencies from having data standardized and centrally hosted that could allow them to handle fewer ad hoc data requests. In addition, the Plan could allow Participants and the Commission to automate some surveillance processes that may currently be labor intensive or processed on legacy systems, which could reduce costs because the primary driver of these costs is FTE costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz22-4" NAME="fr_pz22-4">2895</a></p>
          <p id="c34f2d96-05e1-4062-897d-e511ee541b36">The Commission agrees with the commenters that suggested that the period of duplicative reporting could be associated with reduced benefits from the Plan. In particular, the Commission now acknowledges that in addition to involving significant costs, the period of duplicative reporting would be associated with reduced benefits in the form of potentially lower data quality and potential loss of efficiency and effectiveness of reporting in the short-term. Examples of losses in efficiency could include conflicting field definitions in CAT and OATS; differences in required corrections to the same errors across two different systems; and contention for the same reporting resources applied across two or more systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pANyW" NAME="fr_pANyW">2896</a></p>
          <p id="080920c1-9520-4e4a-965c-b399686c6ffb">Regarding the comment that SROs lack incentives to retire duplicative reporting systems, the Commission notes that the requirement that SROs implement surveillance using the Central Repository within 14 months of the Effective Date limits the incentives for the SROs to delay retiring duplicative systems because they will gain the capability of performing surveillance within CAT. However, the Commission acknowledges that small Industry Members will not yet be reporting to the Central Repository when the SROs gain this capacity. Consequently, SROs will by necessity be performing surveillance on data other than CAT Data until small Industry Members are reporting to the Central Repository and their CAT Data quality allows adequate surveillance using CAT Data. As discussed in Participants&#8217; Response Letter II, as the Participants face significant costs in running duplicative systems, and to the extent that such systems are extraneous for regulatory purposes, the Participants would desire to cease their operation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz23-3" NAME="fr_pz23-3">2897</a> Consequently, the Commission believes the SROs are incented to retire these duplicative systems and move surveillance solely to the Central Repository as quickly as feasible.</p>
          <p id="a6f41e40-d4f7-49f3-88fd-474af7eeb8ce">After considering these comments and responses from the Participants, potential changes in the Plan, the Commission has updated its analysis of the effects of duplicative reporting on efficiency. First, the Commission has updated its estimate of the expected duplicative reporting period and now believes that it is likely to be shorter than estimated in the Notice.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz23-4" NAME="fr_pz23-4">2898</a> This would potentially result in the Commission and SROs realizing gains to efficiency earlier than what was stated in the Notice. Second, as discussed previously, the Commission now acknowledges that duplicative reporting may not result in efficiencies with duplicative reporting costs of less than $1.7 billion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz23-5" NAME="fr_pz23-5">2899</a> Furthermore, the Commission now believes that the period of duplicative reporting may create inefficiencies, such as contention for the same reporting resources to correct errors across two different systems, and that might reduce the quality of data being reporting to CAT during the period of duplicative reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAKAo" NAME="fr_pAKAo">2900</a> Regardless of the loss in efficiency due to duplicative reporting, the Commission nonetheless believes that the Plan will result in long-term gains to efficiency for the reasons stated earlier in this Section.</p>
          <p id="d7f8e677-b481-4f60-9c71-78f96b77b876">b. Effects of Certain Costs of the Plan on Efficiency</p>
          <p id="6159e8e3-be41-4a0a-b27e-932e6ee92b7d">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the fact that the Plan anticipated that the implementation of CAT will introduce new costs related to data mapping and data dictionary creation, and add new expenditures, such as staff time for compliance with encryption requirements associated with the transmission of PII.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-5" NAME="fr_pz24-5">2901</a> While the Commission recognized these are additional activities and costs that the Plan would require, it viewed these as additional costs rather than inefficiencies. While the Commission could not quantify the magnitude of these costs, it viewed these as having a relatively minor contribution to overall costs of the Plan because they impose technical requirements on systems that the industry will need to significantly alter to comply with other provisions in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-6" NAME="fr_pz24-6">2902</a> Commenters did not provide any additional information or analysis that the Commission believes would warrant changes to its analysis or conclusions regarding these costs and therefore continues to view these as costs rather than inefficiencies</p>
          <p id="39986593-8c52-47cf-99de-26c2c3f9c590">Additionally, the Commission discussed the Plan&#8217;s statement that there could be a market inefficiency effect related to the funding proposal for the Plan. The Plan indicated that the Funding Model for the Plan could create disincentives for the provision of liquidity, which could impair market quality and increase the costs to investors to transact.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz24-7" NAME="fr_pz24-7">2903</a> The Commission discussed in the Notice two ways that the cost allocation methodology could negatively impact efficiency. First, data reporters could respond to the Funding Model by taking actions to limit their fee payments, such as exiting the market or reducing their activity levels. Second, the funding proposal for the CAT NMS Plan to align fees closely with the amounts that are required to cover costs could create incentives for the Plan Processor or Operating Committee to propose a cost schedule for the CAT that matches a given fee schedule, but is not the most efficient cost schedule for meeting CAT&#8217;s regulatory objectives.</p>
          <p id="f37d44d5-9b53-4622-86a2-bfca91de8df4">The Commission received a comment about the concerns the funding proposal in the Plan poses for liquidity provision. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-4" NAME="fr_pz25-4">2904</a> This comment echoed the concerns the Commission discussed in the Notice. The Participants responded to this comment and noted that they actively considered the market quality concerns in devising the proposed funding model, and one of the reasons for proposing a tiered, fixed fee funding model was to limit the disincentives to providing liquidity to the market. In particular, the Participants believed that a funding model based on message volume was far more likely to affect market behavior.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-5" NAME="fr_pz25-5">2905</a></p>
          <p id="cd213525-7102-468d-9ae6-2ab246493f20">In response to this comment, the Commission notes that it is amending the Plan to require the Participants to provide the Commission with a report on the impact of tiered-fees on market liquidity, including an analysis of the impact of the tiered-fee structure on Industry Members&#8217; provision of liquidity 36 months after effectiveness of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-6" NAME="fr_pz25-6">2906</a> While the Commission continues to recognize that negative effects on efficiency could result from the Funding Model, for the reasons discussed in Section IV.F above, the Commission is approving the Funding Model as amended by the Commission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAFSZ" NAME="fr_pAFSZ">2907</a></p>

          <p id="863ddd09-d260-4626-822a-a29218909e31">In the Notice, the Commission examined the potential effects on capital formation discussed in the Plan in addition to other potential effects on capital formation that the Commission believed could result if the Plan is approved.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-6" NAME="fr_pz26-6">2908</a> The Plan&#8217;s analysis regarding capital formation concluded that the Plan would generally not have a deleterious effect on capital formation and could bolster capital formation that could lead to increased investor participation in capital markets. The Commission agreed with the rationale of the Plan&#8217;s analysis, but addressed some additional considerations regarding the scope of the Plan&#8217;s effects on capital formation, as well as the channels through which these effects could accrue. The Commission preliminarily believed that the Plan would have a modest positive effect on capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-7" NAME="fr_pz26-7">2909</a></p>
          <p id="3e9cb739-57b2-4108-ac79-ce5a506300ac">The Plan&#8217;s analysis stated that the Plan may improve capital formation by improving investor confidence in the market due to improvements in surveillance. As discussed previously,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-8" NAME="fr_pz26-8">2910</a> in the Notice the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the Plan would provide substantial enhancements to investor protection through improvements to surveillance, particularly for cross-market trading.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-9" NAME="fr_pz26-9">2911</a> Improved surveillance, as well as other regulatory activities, could decrease the rate of violative activity in the market, reducing investor losses due to violative activity. If investors expect fewer losses, this may increase capital formation by facilitating a market where investors could be more likely to mobilize capital into securities markets.</p>
          <p id="e4314b37-9d94-46e5-9951-551a7317e14b">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the CAT NMS Plan could provide additional increases to capital formation in the form of improved allocative efficiency of existing capital within the industry. If investors perceive an environment of improved surveillance, they could be willing to allocate additional capital to liquidity provision or other activities that increase market efficiency. Further, an environment of improved surveillance could result in the reduction of capital allocated to violative activities that impose costs on other market participants, because these market participants may no longer find it desirable to engage in behavior that exposes them to regulatory action.</p>
          <p id="34d5e34a-f7e9-46a5-8799-e37e0aa468fd">The Commission explained, however, that market participants engaging in allowable activity that might be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny under the Plan could allocate capital to other activities to avoid this scrutiny, because even when activity is not violative, interacting with regulators can be costly for market participants.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-5" NAME="fr_pz27-5">2912</a> This reallocation away from allowable activity to avoid regulatory interactions could result in capital allocations that are less efficient.</p>
          <p id="a1d52062-6aa5-437b-b026-7b61a0742727">The Plan stated that the costs from CAT are unlikely to deter investor participation in the capital markets.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz27-6" NAME="fr_pz27-6">2913</a> The Commission noted, however, that the final costs of the Plan and the Funding Model for CAT are not wholly certain at this time; thus, it is the Commission&#8217;s view that there is uncertainty concerning the extent to which investors will bear Plan costs and consequently to what extent Plan costs could affect investors&#8217; allocation of capital. Despite these potential costs to investors, the Commission noted that investors could believe that any additional benefits they receive from the potential of a market that is more effectively regulated justify any additional costs they pay to access capital markets.</p>
          <p id="49976b65-112e-430f-9862-93edd819ce4a">The Commission received several comments on whether the Plan would improve capital formation through investor protection against abusive behavior, and by fostering investor participation. One commenter stated that the Commission needs the CAT Plan not only to understand breakdowns in trading markets, but also to rid the markets of increasingly abusive trading practices. Doing this will protect investors, and foster investor participation, thereby fueling capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz28-4" NAME="fr_pz28-4">2914</a> Another commenter disagreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis and concluded that the Plan could adversely impact investors&#8217; trust in the markets because the Plan lacks connection with real-world problems (i.e., huge investment losses can be accumulated within a split-second; market collapse does not take more than one day; abusive use of financial engineering techniques to synthetically create trades/derivatives to bypass controls).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz28-5" NAME="fr_pz28-5">2915</a></p>
          <p id="892426a8-808b-46eb-be29-ea61c0d6b0ae">In response to the commenter who mentioned that the Commission needs the CAT Plan to not only understand breakdowns in trading markets, but also rid the markets of abusive trading practices, the Commission has noted previously that CAT Data would help regulators with analysis and reconstruction of market events, and also help regulators identify violative behavior and abusive trading through their enforcement investigations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz28-6" NAME="fr_pz28-6">2916</a></p>
          <p id="4df56870-44fe-43bb-9eb2-5093722ec682">The Commission also disagrees with the commenter who concluded that the Plan could adversely impact investors&#8217; trust in the markets because the Plan lacks a connection with &#8220;real-world problems.&#8221; The Commission believes the Plan has a connection with these &#8220;real-world problems&#8221; because as stated above, CAT Data would help regulators analyze and reconstruct markets,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-6" NAME="fr_pz29-6">2917</a> thereby helping them understand how split-second losses accumulate to investors and the underpinnings of market collapses. CAT Data would also help regulators with surveillance and investigation activities,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-7" NAME="fr_pz29-7">2918</a> and potentially help them to understand the abusive use of financial engineering techniques. The Commission therefore believes that the benefits that CAT Data would provide regulators would also provide benefits to investors of a safer environment for allocating their capital and making financial decisions.</p>
          <p id="625188b1-5cf2-47bc-b33f-60b86bdc0634">Moreover, the changes to the Plan further support the Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusions. Requiring Industry Members to report their LEI to the Central Repository if they have one should result in a greater ability for regulators to identify traders based on their Customer-IDs for the purposes of SRO surveillance. Potentially improved data completeness in terms of Customer-IDs could result in greater benefits to surveillance that would spillover to capital formation than stated in the Notice.</p>
          <p id="8fe440b2-a5d8-499b-b7db-4e01f0b5c13d">b. Data Security</p>
          <p id="578c4090-d599-4126-b169-308c74dc3b34">In the Notice, the Commission agreed with the Plan&#8217;s assessment that data security concerns are unlikely to materially affect capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAbuPh" NAME="fr_pAbuPh">2919</a> In its discussion of capital formation, the Plan recognized that data security concerns could potentially impact capital formation through market participants&#8217; perception that sensitive proprietary data might be vulnerable in case of a data breach at the Central Repository. The Plan&#8217;s analysis discussed the security measures that are required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> and the manner in which they have been implemented in the Plan. It concluded that these security measures are sufficient and that it is unlikely market participants would reduce their participation in markets in a manner that would affect capital formation. The Commission agreed that concerns regarding data security are unlikely to substantially affect capital formation, but that some uncertainty about the risks exist because of the variations in the potential security solutions and their resulting effectiveness.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAYTH" NAME="fr_pAYTH">2920</a></p>
          <p id="34a8f9b1-256c-4ba5-abcd-9d4a1093a898">In the Notice, the Commission discussed how the consequences of a data breach, nonetheless, could be quite severe. A data breach could substantially harm market participants by exposing proprietary information, such as a proprietary trading strategy or the existence of a significant business relationship with either a counterparty or client. The Commission noted, however, that broker-dealers already bear such risks in transmitting regulatory data to SROs and the Commission. The Commission believed that the marginal increase in the risks to broker-dealers associated with a data breach would be unlikely to deter broker-dealers from participating in markets. Finally, the Commission noted that a data breach could potentially reveal PII of investors. To address the potential for harm to the investing public and the health of capital markets through such a breach, the Plan has enhanced requirements for security around PII. The Commission believed that the risk of a breach of PII data would not materially affect investors&#8217; willingness to participate in markets because they already face these risks with PII shared with broker-dealers, though not in one centralized location.</p>
          <p id="caad3bc9-0ffd-4af6-98cf-2198f1887465">Several commenters wrote about data security, and the comments are summarized above in Section IV.D.6. Only one commenter discussed the effects of data security on capital formation. That commenter asserted that &#8220;[i]f investors perceive that the CAT NMS plan leaves their trading strategies and position information vulnerable to discovery and predatory use, interest in equity investing may decrease to the detriment of liquidity and, ultimately, capital formation.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-6" NAME="fr_pz31-6">2921</a> The Commission agrees that investors are sensitive to the protection of their data. The Plan amendments and Participants&#8217; responses to comments provide more details about the required security provisions and more clarity on the applicability of Regulation SCI standards. The Commission believes that these changes should increase the security of CAT Data, and that concerns regarding data security are unlikely to affect capital formation substantially even though there may still be uncertainty regarding potential security solutions and their effectiveness.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-7" NAME="fr_pz31-7">2922</a></p>

          <p id="7c8bdcd4-ec7d-478a-b79f-16524fb48a10">The Commission in the Notice recognized that the Plan&#8217;s likely effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation are dependent to some extent on the performance and decisions of the Plan Processor and the Operating Committee in implementing the Plan, and thus that there is necessarily some uncertainty in the Commission&#8217;s analysis.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-8" NAME="fr_pz31-8">2923</a> The Commission noted that nonetheless, it believed that the Plan contains certain governance provisions, as well as provisions relating to the selection and removal of the Plan Processor, that mitigate this uncertainty by promoting decision-making that could, on balance, have positive effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-7" NAME="fr_pz32-7">2924</a></p>

          <p id="27960e9a-8c2c-497d-a9cf-f837fbf2b45b">(1) Plan Decision-Making Process</p>
          <p id="7f64bc05-ab9d-4d33-b291-4aa024cdd405">The Commission in the Notice stated its preliminary belief that certain governance provisions in the Plan could create inefficiencies in the decision-making process, but that these inefficiencies are limited or exist to promote better decision-making. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-8" NAME="fr_pz32-8">2925</a> Specifically, the Notice stated that the Plan specified three types of voting protocols and when each protocol applies: unanimous voting (only in three circumstances), supermajority voting (in instances considered by the Participants to have a direct and significant impact on the functioning, management, and financing of the CAT system), or majority voting (other, routine matters that arise in the ordinary course of business; as a practical matter the default standard).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-9" NAME="fr_pz32-9">2926</a> The Commission discussed how the Plan&#8217;s voting protocols balanced the efficiency of the decision-making process against the value of considering minority and dissenting opinions. Furthermore, the Commission stated its preliminary agreement with the Plan&#8217;s discussion of the need to balance efficiency in the voting protocols in the Plan and the Participants&#8217; conclusion that the inefficiencies in the voting protocols in the Plan are limited enough to strike a balance between the inefficiencies of the decision-making process and the quality of the decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAguP" NAME="fr_pAguP">2927</a></p>
          <p id="6d939780-116c-4653-aa7a-03f28ad01120">The Commission further noted that the Plan discusses the role of industry representation as part of the governance structure.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-3" NAME="fr_pz33-3">2928</a> The Commission preliminarily agreed with the discussion in the Plan that including industry representation might result in a more efficiently designed CAT, but that an Advisory Committee also adds operational inefficiencies.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-4" NAME="fr_pz33-4">2929</a> The Commission further stated its preliminary belief that as long as the Advisory Committee adds sufficiently useful information, the benefits from the Advisory Committee would justify any operational inefficiencies from the inclusion of the Advisory Committee.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-5" NAME="fr_pz33-5">2930</a></p>
          <p id="442dfce5-26e0-4b65-9a9d-1148ace1a0cf">The Commission is not revising its analysis of the efficiency of the Plan&#8217;s decision-making process at this time. As discussed above, commenters provided information on concerns about current NMS Plan governance and made suggestions on how to more effectively include the Advisory Committee in decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-6" NAME="fr_pz33-6">2931</a> However, these commenters did not provide new insights into the efficiency of the decision-making process itself. As noted above, changes to plan governance to provide greater prominence to certain views could improve plan decision-making, to the extent that better-informed decisions would be superior decisions; on the other hand, larger or more diverse sets of voices could result in deadlocked or delayed decisions, which would impede the efficiency of the decision-making process under the CAT Plan. However, as noted above, the Commission is considering changes more broadly to NMS Plan governance, and any such changes may impact the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAy09" NAME="fr_pAy09">2932</a></p>
          <p id="3ef89b55-f0e1-4a8a-815e-296bccfc8154">(2) Level of Detail in the Plan</p>
          <p id="0704be2d-7aaf-4647-aebd-9c041249de47">The Commission in the Notice also considered an additional source of potential inefficiencies: minimum standards for particular provisions or solutions in Appendix D of the Plan, rather than a specification of the solutions themselves in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-4" NAME="fr_pz34-4">2933</a> The Commission stated that while this approach creates uncertainties surrounding the economic effects of the Plan in the approval process, it also means that the Operating Committee and/or Selection Committee would effectively decide upon the unspecified details when selecting the Plan Processor and when approving the Technical Specifications, and as a result could act much more quickly and at a potentially lower cost than if solutions were specified in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-5" NAME="fr_pz34-5">2934</a> In addition, the Commission explained why specifying details in the Technical Specifications instead of the Plan could make the Plan more agile and efficient in its ability to upgrade and improve the CAT Systems quickly.</p>
          <p id="298dd171-8cc9-4f33-a55b-d04e2c152fde">Several commenters sought to have certain definitions included in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-6" NAME="fr_pz34-6">2935</a> Two commenters sought to have the Plan amended to specify certain of the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-7" NAME="fr_pz34-7">2936</a> Participants commented that incorporating Technical Specifications in the Plan itself would interfere with the development of these specifications by the Plan Processor, and that these items are better suited for the Technical Specifications than the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAjhG" NAME="fr_pAjhG">2937</a> In a similar context, Participants also stated that subjecting Technical Specifications to a full filing process with the Commission would introduce significant delays in the process of developing the Technical Specifications, but that matters that are sufficiently significant to require a change to the Plan would be subjected to Commission review.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pADWe" NAME="fr_pADWe">2938</a></p>
          <p id="9edea451-f667-4e44-84b2-564cf85bad82">The Commission believes that commenters&#8217; requests that certain items be defined in the Plan are an implicit assertion that the Plan strikes the wrong balance with respect to the tradeoff identified in the Notice. In the Notice, the Commission was willing to accept the uncertainty created through the lack of definitions, in exchange for the benefits of permitting the relevant parties the flexibility to adopt the definitions or technical specifications at a later date, when the optimal approach to those issues might be more apparent, along with the flexibility to readily make changes to those items if challenges arise. By requesting that definitions or technical specifications be moved to the Plan, commenters advocate the opposite position: that it is acceptable to risk an inefficient definition in the Technical Specifications now, or to encounter delay or difficulty in changing it later, in exchange for added certainty in the definition or specifications as a part of the Plan approval process. The Commission disagrees. Given the technical nature of the technical specifications, and that the Plan does specify certain minimum standards that provide a floor and therefore certainty with respect to at least certain of the definitions and specifications, the Commission continues to believe that the existing process appropriately balances the need for certainty with the benefits of a flexible process going forward.</p>
          <p id="441c0c71-22b1-4f44-ad30-acf3594444b7">(3) Implementation Efficiency</p>
          <p id="3591d225-0e4b-4e47-ac93-094c4a6a0e9c">In the Notice, the Commission recognized that provisions of the Plan should also promote efficiently implementing expansions to the CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-5" NAME="fr_pz36-5">2939</a> Appendix C of the Plan notes that the Plan Processor must ensure that the Central Repository&#8217;s technical infrastructure is scalable and adaptable.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-6" NAME="fr_pz36-6">2940</a> The Commission explained that these provisions should reduce the costs and time needed for expansions to the Central Repository.</p>
          <p id="65710b81-f84d-4e24-bd71-c2f4c7e0b3ce">Two commenters provided information relevant for the Commission&#8217;s analysis of the efficiency of the initial implementation of the Plan more broadly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-7" NAME="fr_pz36-7">2941</a> In particular, the commenters expressed concerns that the timeline for implementation, including the testing and publication and iterative reviews of the Technical Specifications, would not allow for efficient implementation, potentially affecting the quality of the data coming to CAT from the beginning of its operations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-8" NAME="fr_pz36-8">2942</a> One commenter stated that building in additional capacity and flexibility to expand CAT further over time will increase the scope of efficiencies and ancillary benefits, including long-term cost reductions, even if that additional capacity and flexibility are not absolutely necessary to meet minimum Plan requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-4" NAME="fr_pz37-4">2943</a> Other commenters asserted that the Plan Processor selection should occur before Commission approval of the Plan, because the selection could negate a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the ultimate effects of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-5" NAME="fr_pz37-5">2944</a></p>
          <p id="157908ab-f2d9-4013-b453-8304b5dd04a6">Participants responded to the technical specifications point by stating that they recognize the benefit of iterative interactions between broker-dealers and the Plan Processor in terms of developing and executing final system specifications, which is why Appendix C of the Plan calls for the publication of iterative drafts, as necessary.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz37-6" NAME="fr_pz37-6">2945</a> Participants responded to the comments regarding acceleration of Plan Processor selection by indicating that it would be infeasible to do so from a timing perspective; that the requirements of the CAT could change up until the point the Plan is approved, which could affect the selection process; and that selection is to be performed within two months of Plan effectiveness in any event.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAg4x" NAME="fr_pAg4x">2946</a></p>
          <p id="4fe21a28-a67f-49cb-a4fc-e81cea5098bd">The Commission considered the comments and the Participants&#8217; responses and now recognizes that the timeline for implementation can affect the efficiency of the initial implementation of the Plan. The timeline for implementation in the Plan includes a requirement for the Plan Processor to develop the Technical Specifications by publishing iterative drafts, as needed, and to publish the Technical Specifications one year before Industry Members are required to begin reporting data to the Central Repository, and to commence testing of connectivity and acceptance three months before Industry Members begin reporting data to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-3" NAME="fr_pz38-3">2947</a> The Plan has also been amended to require that the development of the Technical Specifications will begin no later than fifteen months before Industry Member reporting commences. Furthermore, the Plan has been amended to require that the CAT testing environment will be made available to Industry Members on a voluntary basis no later than six months prior to when Industry Members are required to report and that more coordinated, structured testing of the CAT system will begin no later than three months prior to when Industry Members are required to report data to CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-4" NAME="fr_pz38-4">2948</a></p>
          <p id="0fa6c435-7006-482d-8b95-cf8833e0bd1b">The Commission believes that the modification to the Plan requiring development of Technical Specifications at least 15 months before reporting begins will ensure more advance notice to the Participants about specific functionalities of CAT, and that this could potentially mitigate inefficiency in the implementation of the Plan. Moreover, modifications to the Plan requiring that the CAT testing environment be made available to Industry Members before they begin reporting will provide additional time for Industry Members to test their reporting procedures for the CAT System prior to implementation. They will also further mitigate inefficiencies related to the implementation of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz38-5" NAME="fr_pz38-5">2949</a> Further, as explained below, the Commission understands that the Bids of the three remaining Bidders propose accepting existing messaging protocols (e.g., FIX), rather than requiring CAT Reporters to use a new format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-7" NAME="fr_pz39-7">2950</a> This reduces some of the uncertainty regarding implementation times because CAT Reporters may not need to build new systems to report data to the Central Repository.</p>
          <p id="a5e46fe4-ae28-4e47-b22b-2459b8615d33">In response to the comment on building in additional capacity and flexibilities to expand further over time, the Commission believes that this comment is consistent with its analysis in the Notice that ensuring that the Central Repository&#8217;s technical infrastructure is scalable and adaptable should reduce the costs and time needed for future expansions. Further, the Commission believes that provisions in the Plan already address this issue.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-8" NAME="fr_pz39-8">2951</a></p>
          <p id="79eb5b28-052c-453b-b267-c60ffb303dda">With respect to accelerating the selection of the Plan Processor, this could trade one potential inefficiency for another: whereas there could be greater certainty about the effects of the Plan by locking in certain choices in advance, locking in those choices could result in inefficiencies if modifications to the Plan in the approval process change the Plan Processor selection. As inefficiencies in the choice of the Plan Processor could persist for the length of the Plan Processor&#8217;s tenure, the Commission believes selecting the Plan Processor a short number of months after the approval of the Plan balances the need for expeditiously moving forward with implementation choices to provide sufficient time for implementation with the need to select the Plan Processor best positioned to achieve the regulatory benefits of the Plan.</p>

          <p id="25cb9834-a795-4f7a-bc3d-c6e47317c80d">In the Notice, the Commission discussed the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s use of an &#8220;RFP&#8221; to select the Plan Processor that would design, build, and operate the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz39-9" NAME="fr_pz39-9">2952</a> The winning bidder becomes the sole supplier of the operation of the Central Repository. The Commission stated its preliminary belief that this structure is necessary to achieve the benefits of a single consolidated source of regulatory data, but that the competitiveness of the selection process would thus influence the ultimate economic effect of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-6" NAME="fr_pz40-6">2953</a> The Commission further stated its preliminary belief that the selection process generally promotes competition, but that there are also a few potential limits on competition.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-7" NAME="fr_pz40-7">2954</a> With respect to the Plan Processor&#8217;s behavior following selection, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that the threat of replacement of the Plan Processor could incentivize it to set costs and performance competitively, but that the high cost of replacing the Plan Processor could limit these incentives.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz40-8" NAME="fr_pz40-8">2955</a> These are discussed further below.</p>
          <p id="7dbc7ba3-98cf-4641-95b9-369fc1a158e1">(1) Competitiveness of the Plan Processor Selection Process</p>
          <p id="d8e16fb8-4bef-4f43-a41d-3ef686ce3680">In the Notice, the Commission stated its belief that two elements determine the competitiveness of the bidding process: the voting process and the degree of transparency in the bidding process. The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the Plan provisions relevant to these two factors could promote competition in the bidding process and limit the risk that the selection of the Plan Processor would be affected by a conflict of interest, thereby promoting better decision-making.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAgcj" NAME="fr_pAgcj">2956</a> Specifically, the Commission noted that, in the voting process, there is &#8220;a residual risk in having an SRO among the bidders; it is possible that voting Participants would be biased for or against that SRO because they compete with that SRO in another market (and could gain a competitive advantage in that market by acting as Plan Processor) or because of repeated interactions with that SRO.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-4" NAME="fr_pz41-4">2957</a> Moreover, the Commission noted that &#8220;to the extent the Operating Committee has specific preferred solutions as to how the Plan should be implemented, the degree to which the Committee is transparent about those preferences in the bidding process would affect the competitiveness of that process&#8221;&#8212;but that &#8220;[t]he Commission has no reason to believe that the Operating Committee has preferred solutions beyond what is in the Plan that would significantly impact the competitiveness of the Plan Processor selection process.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-5" NAME="fr_pz41-5">2958</a></p>
          <p id="9d5312ab-29a0-45bf-afa5-3d021747b8f0">One commenter stated that, rather than a competitive process for selection of the Plan Processor, the selection of FINRA would best promote efficiencies, as it appears to have the required technology mostly in place, or can easily adapt existing technology to CAT&#8217;s requirements; it already deals with the CAT Data; and it already regulates broker-dealers and ATSs that will submit data to the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz41-6" NAME="fr_pz41-6">2959</a> The Participants responded that completing the competitive process is most likely to promote an innovative and efficient CAT solution.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAVl1" NAME="fr_pAVl1">2960</a></p>
          <p id="52bc7265-e02b-499a-8ba1-eb9378b785a8">In the Commission&#8217;s view, a competitive process for the selection of the Plan Processor is most likely to lead to the best outcome for the CAT. The commenter has raised a number of reasons why FINRA&#8217;s bid may be the most persuasive. However, different approaches embodied in different bids would be expected to embody different tradeoffs. These tradeoffs can be considered as part of a competitive bidding process, with the best bid chosen in the end. The Commission believes that completing the competitive bidding process is most likely to result in a CAT system that best balances cost, benefits, and efficiencies.</p>
          <p id="85b34da2-4c16-40ad-b423-5f27d20cae84">(2) Competitive Incentives of the Selected Plan Processor</p>
          <p id="162ea27c-a1e3-47f7-8b27-a294cdd387b0">In the Notice, the Commission discussed how the Plan could create competitive incentives for the selected Plan Processor by detailing strong requirements for the Plan Processor and providing an efficient mechanism to remove the selected Plan Processor and introduce an alternative Plan Processor in the event of underperformance. Here, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that the Plan provides the selected Plan Processor with competitive incentives because the Plan contains defined procedures for monitoring and removing the Plan Processor for failure to perform functions or otherwise. While removal for performance that is not &#8220;reasonably acceptable&#8221; is by Majority Vote of the Operating Committee, assessing the Plan Processor&#8217;s performance and demonstrating failings may be difficult; if that standard is not met, then removal is by Supermajority Vote, which may be more challenging to attain. The degree of difficulty of removal thus could limit the Plan Processor&#8217;s competitive incentives. Similarly, the potentially extensive costs of switching to another Plan Processor (including selection of a new Plan Processor, which could potentially require rebuilding the Central Repository and implementation of new Technical Specifications) could limit competitive incentives.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz42-6" NAME="fr_pz42-6">2961</a></p>
          <p id="1060a295-7304-47a2-9855-b16258b9028c">One commenter expressed a view that the continuing incentives of the Plan Processor are a legitimate concern, and that the contract with the Plan Processor should be rebid every 5 years, because it would &#8220;prevent the stagnation of the CAT system and encourage innovation&#8221; and &#8220;force the SEC to re-evaluate the performance of the system and the Plan Processor at least periodically, with the benefit of public input.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz43-7" NAME="fr_pz43-7">2962</a> The Participants responded by asserting that the Operating Committee will be reviewing Plan Processor performance, and may remove the Plan Processor by Supermajority Vote at any time, or by a Majority Vote where the Plan Processor has failed to reasonably perform its obligations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pACjF" NAME="fr_pACjF">2963</a></p>
          <p id="b44b8150-e768-4266-ab7d-7eba5fef762b">The Commission has considered the views of the commenter on the competitive incentives of the Plan Processor and continues to believe that the Plan provides competitive incentives to control costs and promote the performance of the Plan. The commenter did not provide any additional information or analysis that the Commission believes would warrant changes to its analysis, nor does the Commission believe that the modifications to the Plan warrant changes to this aspect of the economic analysis. With respect to the comment that suggested rebidding every 5 years, the Commission agrees that a rebidding process after some period of time could provide a focal point for determining whether other technologies or other entities could be preferable to the incumbent Plan Processor. However, the existing provisions for removing a Plan Processor in the event of underperformance, and the existing authority of the Commission to oversee the CAT NMS Plan, already provide some incentives for continuous CAT innovation and cost reductions. Moreover, a bidding process is not a costless exercise; it requires hundreds or thousands of hours of work on the part of bidders to prepare and submit bids, and Plan Participants to review bids. Additionally, it is not clear whether the rebidding process sought by the commenter would consider the costs to switch as part of the incumbent&#8217;s bid (in which case it would significantly advantage the incumbent), or would consider bids without reference to incumbency (which could result in the imposition of inefficient costs if the benefits of the new Plan Processor do not exceed the costs to switch).</p>

          <p id="31c01d0f-e5a6-4ead-9485-5768368cbd6e">The Commission considered these comments and the Participants&#8217; response and now believes that the costs of requiring sub-millisecond timestamps could be significant for some broker-dealers, and also across broker-dealers, because the broker-dealer industry does not broadly apply sub-millisecond timestamps. In response to the commenters that stated that exchanges and certain other categories of market participants already may be capable of sub-millisecond timestamps,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-6" NAME="fr_pz48-6">2977</a> the Commission notes that if a CAT Reporter uses timestamps in increments finer than milliseconds, that CAT Reporter must use those finer increments when reporting to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz48-7" NAME="fr_pz48-7">2978</a> Therefore, the Central Repository will capture finer timestamps in those cases. In response to the commenter who stated that the reporting of finer timestamps would be unnecessarily expensive for those Reporters who choose to capture finer timestamps, the Commission agrees that some Reporters may need to update their reporting systems to report these finer timestamps and therefore may incur additional costs. However, it is unclear to the Commission, and it was left unspecified by the commenter, how many CAT Reporters would need to update their systems and furthermore whether these Reporters would already be updating their systems in response to the Plan&#8217;s millisecond reporting standard, so that only incremental costs above this standard should be considered. Finally, the Commission agrees with the Participants&#8217; stated view that the Plan provides for the quality of CAT Data to improve as CAT Reporters use more granular timestamps.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-4" NAME="fr_pz49-4">2979</a> However, because the broker-dealer industry does not broadly apply sub-millisecond timestamps, many CAT Reporters will use timestamps to the millisecond, and the Commission continues to believe that millisecond timestamps may be inadequate to allow sequencing of the majority of unrelated Reportable Events. The commenters supporting the Plan either state that one millisecond is &#8220;okay&#8221; or state that it is not possible to sequence &#8220;all&#8221; events regardless of timestamp granularity. The Commission acknowledges that seeking to sequence &#8220;all&#8221; unrelated Reportable Events may not be possible, but maintains, as discussed in the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz49-5" NAME="fr_pz49-5">2980</a> that a sub-millisecond timestamp could improve the ability to sequence the majority of orders, subject to limitations from the clock synchronization standard.

Therefore, a lower Error Rate in data available before T+5 could, in certain regulatory contexts, be meaningful. Additionally, because OATS currently has a lower observed error rate than the rate in the CAT NMS Plan, a reduction in CAT Error Rates may accelerate the retirement of OATS.

Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that reducing Error Rates in the Plan could increase the implementation and ongoing costs incurred by CAT Reporters and the Central Repository as compared to costs estimated in the Plan.</p>
          <p id="8dfc5c0f-15b6-4e5c-8a55-0637e5023201">The Commission agrees with commenters who indicated the need to tie error rates to retirement of duplicative systems. The Commission believes that regulators may find it advantageous to retain other systems until CAT Data is at least as accurate as those systems, and therefore continues to believe that reducing the maximum error rate could accelerate their retirement. However, the CAT NMS Plan does not require a particular target Error Rate before other systems can be retired, so the Commission continues to be unable to assess the benefits of specific maximum error rates as they relate to system retirement.</p>
          <p id="942fa17b-8a38-486c-b69c-9cf3808cdd65">In response to the comments suggesting that the Plan focus only on post-correction error rates, the Commission agrees that the post-correction error rates, which the Plan states will be de minimis, are most important to data quality, but retains the belief that lower pre-correction error rates could be meaningful. This is because, as discussed in the Notice, regulators also have essential needs for uncorrected data prior to T+5, although the Commission believes that most regulatory uses would involve data after T+5.</p>
          <p id="a72a43f1-52d1-41a5-ae59-85beb1a232fa">With respect to the comment that expressed concern that if small broker-dealers voluntarily report to CAT during the first two years of CAT operations, then the utility of CAT will be diminished because they would be permitted to report with limitless errors,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz53-4" NAME="fr_pz53-4">2999</a> the Commission disagrees with this interpretation of the CAT NMS Plan, as discussed above because the Maximum Error Rate would apply to anyone reporting to CAT, whether mandated to do so in accordance with the CAT NMS Plan or voluntarily.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAx9X" NAME="fr_pAx9X">3000</a></p>

          <p id="549e79c2-71db-47bd-83eb-980302182736">In the Notice, the Commission solicited comment on whether the CAT NMS Plan should impose a T+5 deadline for the submission of corrected data rather than the T+3 deadline. The Commission preliminarily believed that the delays in regulatory access from a T+5 deadline would reduce regulators&#8217; ability to conduct surveillance and slow the response to market events relative to the CAT NMS Plan. At the same time, the Commission also believed that T+5 error correction might reduce costs to industry relative to the CAT NMS Plan, although the Commission was not aware of any existing cost estimates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAcju" NAME="fr_pAcju">3005</a></p>
          <p id="18dbcf67-4359-44a6-84e2-a534d172ece5">Two commenters disagreed with the T+3 error correction deadline proposed in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-3" NAME="fr_pz55-3">3006</a> One of the commenters noted that the T+3 deadline &#8220;appears too aggressive at this time,&#8221; because &#8220;the fact that roll-out of the CAT will include a sharp learning curve for broker-dealers and regulators as they understand and absorb the intricacies of [a] new and complex system such as the CAT.&#8221; The commenter further stated that &#8220;the CAT NMS Plan should be amended to maintain current error correction timeframes until CAT reporting errors are analyzed and better understood by broker-dealers and exchanges, and regulators.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-4" NAME="fr_pz55-4">3007</a></p>
          <p id="1af3a123-150e-42d1-bacb-cb576535ebaf">Likewise, the second commenter maintained that the T+3 deadline may not be achievable until &#8220;the CAT system and its support infrastructure can be proven stable, &#8230; a body of supporting documentation &#8230; can be developed and absorbed by the CAT Reporters&#8221;, and CAT reporting errors are analyzed and better understood.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz55-5" NAME="fr_pz55-5">3008</a> The commenter suggested that the current OATS approach, under which firms have five days from the date they receive notice of the error to submit a correction, should be kept in place for the first year of CAT reporting for each group of CAT Reporters. The commenter noted that &#8220;a less aggressive, measured approach towards reduction in the error correction timeframe over time will produce better quality results, with less overall cost to the industry than the proposed approach.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAs_8" NAME="fr_pAs_8">3009</a> Under this commenter&#8217;s suggested approach, the deadline for the submission of corrected data would be 8:00am on T+6, with corrected data available to regulators by 8:00am on T+8, consistent with the current OATS approach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-3" NAME="fr_pz56-3">3010</a> One commenter stated that the current approach was &#8220;feasible.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-4" NAME="fr_pz56-4">3011</a></p>
          <p id="f5dd2582-f3d2-4194-98a3-bdbe02c53f20">In their response, the Participants stated that they believe that the prompt availability of corrected data is &#8220;imperative to the utility of the Central Repository,&#8221; and that the three-day error correction period &#8220;appropriately balances the need for regulators to access corrected data in a timely manner while taking into consideration the industry&#8217;s concerns.&#8221; <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-5" NAME="fr_pz56-5">3012</a> The Participants acknowledged that a five-day window for error correction is used for OATS reporting currently, but stated their belief that the window in the Plan would allow for better regulatory surveillance and market oversight.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-6" NAME="fr_pz56-6">3013</a> The Participants also stated that, based on a review of OATS data from August 2016, most errors reported to OATS were corrected within six business days of submission (approximately 91.26% of error corrections), with 26.46% of error corrections occurring one day after submission, and 59.45% of error corrections occurring six days after submission (i.e., on the rejection repair deadline).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz56-7" NAME="fr_pz56-7">3014</a> Additionally, approximately 0.48% of error corrections were made on the day of submission, approximately 4.86% of error corrections were made two to five days after submission, and the remaining approximately 8.75% of error corrections were made seven to 36 days after submission.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pATjf" NAME="fr_pATjf">3015</a></p>
          <p id="59f50dc6-4f36-4ce0-8ce4-cc9bc7ea755e">The Commission has considered the comments it received on whether the CAT NMS Plan should impose a T+5 deadline for the submission of corrected data, rather than the T+3 deadline, as well as the Participants&#8217; response.</p>
          <p id="4559611b-c428-4d9d-8036-ec7b66106ca0">The Commission recognizes that broker-dealers and regulators may face a learning curve as they adjust from the current OATS approach, under which firms have five days from the date they receive notice of the error to submit a correction, to the T+3 error correction deadline imposed by the Plan, which will allow firms approximately two days from the date they receive notice of the error to submit the correction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz57-3" NAME="fr_pz57-3">3016</a> The Commission also recognizes that a T+5 deadline may be easier to achieve than the T+3 deadline, and therefore may be less costly. The Commission notes that, while the data provided by the Participants indicates that approximately 26% of error corrections currently are made on T+1, approximately 59% of OATS error corrections are currently made on T+6, the last day of the OATS error correction period, indicating that many OATS reporters will likely be required to change their error correction practices to achieve the T+3 deadline in the Plan. The Commission also recognizes that keeping a deadline of T+5 for the first year of CAT reporting for each group of CAT Reporters may potentially improve the quality of CAT Data during that year. However, the Commission believes that a T+5 deadline would reduce the timeliness benefits of the Plan by delaying regulatory access to CAT Data during that year. The Commission continues to believe that the delays in regulatory access from a T+5 deadline would reduce regulators&#8217; ability to conduct surveillance and slow the response to market events relative to the CAT NMS Plan, and would largely negate the timeliness benefits discussed above in connection with the error correction timeline.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz58-6" NAME="fr_pz58-6">3017</a></p>

          <p id="23bfe15b-5477-4aad-acb6-b37dfd70caa4">In the Notice, the Commission solicited comment on an alternative to the CAT NMS Plan that would allow CAT Reporters to report using their existing symbologies, rather than listing exchange symbology.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz58-7" NAME="fr_pz58-7">3018</a> The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that, in light of the requirement for the Plan Processor to maintain a complete symbology database, the requirement that CAT Reporters report using listing exchange symbology may result in unnecessary costs to CAT Reporters. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believed that the alternative of allowing CAT Reporters to use their existing symbologies for reporting purposes could significantly reduce the costs for exchanges and broker-dealers to report order events to the Central Repository, as compared to the approach in the CAT NMS Plan, without a significant impact on the expected benefits of the Plan or the costs to operate the Central Repository.</p>
          <p id="a9f95aac-8eec-44b7-8b74-868fa9db4d02">The Commission received three comments relevant to this alternative. One commenter stated that, &#8220;in order to minimize cost and invasiveness to the industry,&#8221; the Central Repository should accept existing symbology &#8220;as-is&#8221; rather than requiring listing exchange symbology.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz58-8" NAME="fr_pz58-8">3019</a> Another commenter stated that using listing exchange symbology was costly not only for equities, as discussed in the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAEDLms" NAME="fr_pAEDLms">3020</a> but also for options.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-3" NAME="fr_pz59-3">3021</a> The final commenter stated that, &#8220;it would be more efficient to have the Central Repository manage the mapping tables in one place, as it is less error prone&#8230; than to have all reporting broker-dealers mapping to their separate tables,&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-4" NAME="fr_pz59-4">3022</a> and that the use of existing symbology &#8220;does provide a data quality advantage.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-5" NAME="fr_pz59-5">3023</a> However, the commenter also stated that it did not expect the elimination of the requirement to use existing symbology to result in a large cost savings.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz59-6" NAME="fr_pz59-6">3024</a> While the commenter did not explain why the cost savings would be minimal, as discussed in the Baseline Section above, the Participants&#8217; response notes that broker-dealers currently use listing exchange symbology to report to OATS and existing messaging protocols do not necessarily use a standard symbology. Therefore, in the absence of such a requirement, CAT reporters might use &#8220;bespoke&#8221; symbologies to report that would be difficult for the Central Repository to map.</p>
          <p id="39034729-68c1-4b8b-b45b-f8e497927919">In the Participants&#8217; response, the Participants stated their belief that the requirement for CAT Reporters to use listing exchange symbology &#8220;is the most efficient, cost-effective and least error prone approach to symbology,&#8221; and that based on discussions with the DAG, it is their understanding that &#8220;all Industry Members subject to OATS or EBS reporting requirements currently use the symbology of the listing exchange when submitting such reports.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pApcJ" NAME="fr_pApcJ">3025</a> They further stated that allowing CAT Reporters to determine symbology would &#8220;require each CAT Reporter to submit regular mapping symbology information to the CAT, thereby increasing the complexity and likelihood for errors in the CAT.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-3" NAME="fr_pz60-3">3026</a> However, the Participants stated that they &#8220;understand that some industry messaging formats, such as some exchange binary formats, require symbology other than the primary listing exchange symbology,&#8221; and that in these and similar cases, the Participants recommended that the Plan be amended to permit the use of the required symbology.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz60-4" NAME="fr_pz60-4">3027</a> The Participants also added that, based on their understanding of current practices, Industry Members currently employ technical solutions and/or systems that allow them to translate symbology in the correct format when submitting data to exchanges.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA4X8" NAME="fr_pA4X8">3028</a></p>
          <p id="154e0787-448f-4339-8a85-85c97227cdad">The Commission is revising its economic analysis of this alternative in light of the comments and the Participants&#8217; response. While commenters generally agreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice, they seemed to indicate that the cost savings from a requirement to use existing symbology would not be large. Further, the additional baseline information in the Participants&#8217; response also suggests that the cost savings might not be significant. The Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice hinged on the necessity of running an additional process on messaging protocol data prior to submitting the data. The Commission believed the cost savings and the data quality benefits would come from avoiding this additional process, which would need to be built and maintained and could add errors to the data. However, the Participants&#8217; response indicates that existing messaging protocols may already have integrated processes that translate symbols efficiently and accurately prior to routing to an exchange. While the Participants&#8217; response does not indicate that the messaging protocols translate symbols for other types of messages, the Commission presumes that the functionality should be transferable to other message types, including order originations and routes to other broker-dealers. Because this functionality operates for business purposes, broker-dealers have a strong incentive to ensure its accuracy. Therefore, the Commission no longer believes that eliminating the requirement to translate symbols would improve accuracy and significantly reduce costs. In addition, the Commission now believes that eliminating the requirement could result in an additional cost to the Central Repository and a potential reduction in accuracy because it could involve having to map &#8220;bespoke&#8221; symbologies into one standardized symbology.</p>

The Commission explained that it could not quantify the reduction in costs from this alternative because it lacked data on the proportion of clock synchronization costs that are associated with event logging and the proportion of those costs that could be avoided by alternative event logging requirements. The Commission discussed its preliminary belief that any reduction in benefits from this alternative, as compared to the CAT NMS Plan&#8217;s approach for clock synchronization, would be minor because the inclusion of clock synchronization checks that required no clock adjustment would not improve regulators&#8217; ability to sequence events. The Commission noted, however, that enforcement of clock synchronization requirements could be more difficult without comprehensive logging requirements that document firms&#8217; actions to comply with requirements; consequently, relaxing the logging requirement could also reduce incentives to comply with the clock synchronization requirements.</p>
          <p id="586abcf5-fc86-4308-ae60-bc28f1207d94">As discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz62-7" NAME="fr_pz62-7">3030</a> one commenter supported the alternative raised by the Commission that any requirement to maintain a log of clock synchronization events should only require logging of clock synchronization exceptions, not all clock synchronization events, noting that requiring logging of all events would be costly for some broker-dealers.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz62-8" NAME="fr_pz62-8">3031</a> However, the commenter did not provide any additional information that would allow the Commission to quantify the cost savings of logging only these events. Therefore, while the Commission continues to believe that there could be cost savings from logging only exceptions to the clock offset, the Commission remains unable to quantify the reduction in costs from this alternative.

The Commission solicited comment on each of the minimum data accessibility standards required in the Plan. The Commission also discussed several examples in particular, and requested comment on alternative standards that might be adopted in each case.</p>
          <p id="c8b374f9-9e74-4959-bb3a-9c9cf9ad5256">In the Notice, the Commission noted that the CAT NMS Plan requires query responses for various types of queries of 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 3 hours, and 24 hours, where the simplest queries involving scanning narrow sets of data would be required to return in 5 minutes and complex queries scanning multiple days of data and returning large datasets would be required to return within 24 hours. While the benefits of direct access to CAT Data depend on reasonably fast query responses, the Commission recognized that faster query response times come at a cost. The Commission stated that it did not have detailed information on significant breakpoints in those costs to judge whether slightly longer response times than those in the Plan could significantly reduce the costs of developing, maintaining, and operating the Central Repository. The Commission recognized that the detailed information on numerous other minimum standards regarding regulator access to CAT Data is similarly unclear. Therefore, the Commission requested comment regarding all standards for regulatory access and whether technology creates natural breakpoints in costs such that a particular alternative could reduce the costs of the Plan without significantly reducing benefits or could increase benefits without significantly increasing costs.</p>
          <p id="26271523-3987-455e-b458-a4213a0a2b64">Commenters made a number of suggestions regarding data accessibility standards. One commenter stated that it was unclear whether the CAT would be able to support various types of data analysis by regulators within the Central Repository, and noted that, without that ability, all of the analyses must be done outside of the CAT Repository and within the regulators&#8217; own infrastructure, which would require bulk extraction and could lead to increased costs and security concerns due to the need to store multiple copies of CAT Data with various SROs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz64-3" NAME="fr_pz64-3">3033</a> The commenter recommended that the Plan clearly specify the analytical capability requirements with respect to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AsY9" NAME="fr_AsY9">3034</a> Another commenter recommended that the CAT support real-time ingestion, processing and surveillance, and that the CAT provide regulators with access to real-time analytics.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_ApoAF" NAME="fr_ApoAF">3035</a> One commenter believed that the proposed model and timeframe for regulatory access is consistent with the Commission&#8217;s regulatory objectives, but recommended the use of pre-defined extract templates and uniform global formats such as ISO 20022 to allow for exchange of data between both national and global regulators.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AGTO" NAME="fr_AGTO">3036</a> That commenter also suggested that there should be an ability for regulators to perform analyses within the CAT environment, and that there should be flexible search/filtering capabilities.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A8VS" NAME="fr_A8VS">3037</a></p>

However, as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a>, the CAT NMS Plan commits to incorporating a discussion of how and when to implement the inclusion of some primary market information into a document outlining how additional Eligible Securities could be reported to the Central Repository (the &#8220;Discussion Document&#8221;), which would be jointly provided to the Commission within six months after effectiveness of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz69-7" NAME="fr_pz69-7">3059</a> Additionally, as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)(1)(vi)</a>, the Plan includes a discussion of the feasibility, benefits, and costs of including primary market transactions in the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-4" NAME="fr_pz70-4">3060</a> As explained in the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-5" NAME="fr_pz70-5">3061</a> the discussion in the CAT NMS Plan divides the primary market information into two categories: information on top-account allocations and information on subaccount allocations. Top-account allocations refer to allocations to institutional clients and retail broker-dealers during the book-building process. Top-account institutions and broker-dealers make the subsequent subaccount allocations to the actual accounts receiving the shares. The Plan concludes that including information on subaccount allocations in the CAT would provide significant benefits without unreasonable costs, while including information on top-account allocations would provide marginal benefits at significantly higher costs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz70-6" NAME="fr_pz70-6">3062</a></p>
          <p id="3302f4d8-5544-4456-822f-23f97cc3a4a7">As discussed in the Notice, the Plan states that &#8220;the Participants are supportive of considering the reporting of Primary Market Transactions, but only at the subaccount level, and would incorporate analysis of this requirement, including how and when to implement such a requirement, into their document outlining how additional Eligible Securities could be reported to the Central Repository, in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">SEC Rule 613(i)</a> and Section 6.11 of the Plan.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAoOY0" NAME="fr_pAoOY0">3063</a> The Plan therefore would limit the discussion of reporting primary market transactions in the Discussion Document to the subaccount level.</p>
          <p id="e1623aad-79ca-469c-a5d5-6b4a5b8c554e">In the Notice, the Commission solicited comment on the alternative approach that would broaden the required scope of the discussion of primary market allocation information in the Discussion Document to include an analysis of incorporating both top-account and subaccount allocation information for primary market transactions into the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-3" NAME="fr_pz71-3">3064</a> To assess this alternative, the Commission examined the benefits and costs of ultimately including top-account allocations in the CAT. The Commission preliminarily believed that the potential benefits of including top-account allocation information in the CAT could be significant and that the costs of including top-account allocation information could be lower than what is described in the CAT NMS Plan and appropriate in light of significant potential benefits. For these reasons, the Commission preliminarily believed that top-account allocation information should not be excluded from the Discussion Document.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz71-4" NAME="fr_pz71-4">3065</a></p>
          <p id="ac8e3e10-e8eb-4dfe-9876-6959dba37856">In the Notice, the Commission discussed several benefits of including top-account allocation information, in addition to subaccount allocation information, for primary market transactions in CAT. First, the Commission noted that top-account allocation information would be necessary to surveil for prohibited activities in the book-building process and would improve the efficiency of investigations into such prohibited activities. For example, examinations of &#8220;spinning,&#8221; &#8220;laddering,&#8221; and other &#8220;quid pro quo&#8221; arrangements would benefit from inclusion of top-account allocation information in CAT Data. Second, the Commission noted that top-account allocation information would provide very useful insights into IPO and follow-on allocations in market analysis and that such insights would help inform rulemaking and other policy decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAXV1" NAME="fr_pAXV1">3066</a></p>
          <p id="64f18c7e-3aa3-487a-b025-a84057338592">As discussed in the Notice,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz72-4" NAME="fr_pz72-4">3067</a> the CAT NMS Plan estimates that for broker-dealers to implement a system to record and report both top-account and subaccount allocation information for primary market transactions would cost $234.8 million, whereas implementing a system with only subaccount information would cost $58.7 million.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz72-5" NAME="fr_pz72-5">3068</a> The inclusion of top-account allocation information accounts for the difference of $176.1 million.</p>
          <p id="dbb3b64f-183f-4cce-a39d-900669c42b53">In the Notice, the Commission discussed its preliminary belief that the implementation costs of adding top-account allocation information may be lower than those estimated in the CAT NMS Plan, for several reasons. First, the Commission noted that, in combination with an alternative that would require less granular timestamps or a larger allowable clock offset on less time-sensitive systems, including the systems for reporting top-account allocation information, the costs for including top-account allocation information would be lower than indicated in the Plan. Second, the Commission noted that the Plan&#8217;s estimate was sensitive to the number of underwriters. In particular, the estimates assumed that all underwriters participating in an offering would need to implement changes for top-account allocation information. In contrast, the Commission suspected that lead underwriters could have all of the information necessary to report the top-account allocation information. If so, then only the lead underwriters would need to implement systems changes to report top-account allocation information. Estimating costs only for lead underwriters could result in a much smaller estimate.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA5NF" NAME="fr_pA5NF">3069</a></p>
          <p id="af740096-0ff7-400c-92fb-aa64445735b3">The Commission noted that it did not have an estimate of the ongoing costs of underwriters reporting top-account allocation information. However, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the reporting of primary market transactions would generate a total of 1.2 million CAT Reportable Events per year. The Commission noted that this total was much smaller than the number of Reportable Events in the secondary market (trillions). The Commission preliminarily believed that the ongoing costs of reporting primary market transactions would be a fraction of the ongoing costs of secondary market reporting and would likely be supported by staff already engaged to maintain CAT reporting.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz73-4" NAME="fr_pz73-4">3070</a></p>
          <p id="564df746-73cb-447f-92bf-3bb89fbf9d7e">The Commission received three comment letters that provided information relevant to the Commission&#8217;s economic analysis of this alternative, though the comments focused more on the inclusion of primary market transactions in the initial phase of the Plan as opposed to in the Discussion Document. In particular, commenters provided information relevant to the baseline, benefits, and costs of the inclusion of top-account primary market information in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz73-5" NAME="fr_pz73-5">3071</a></p>
          <p id="a0b41a58-711f-42b0-aff2-62c98e153007">Commenters provided information relevant to the current baseline of the underwriting process and primary market transaction records. One commenter documented significant diversity across underwriters in the volume of deals and workflows and provided more precise information on that diversity than included in the Notice or Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAsKo" NAME="fr_pAsKo">3072</a> The commenter further stated that the processes that handle top-account allocations are very separate from the secondary market systems. Another commenter described three stages in the offering process: 1) preliminary indications of interest, 2) final top-account allocation, and 3) subsequent subaccount allocations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-3" NAME="fr_pz74-3">3073</a> Both commenters agreed that indications of interest in top-account allocations can change numerous times,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-4" NAME="fr_pz74-4">3074</a> but one commenter indicates the existence of a final top-account allocation (Stage 2) while the other does not.</p>
          <p id="04694510-975f-405c-aa05-181d02b1eaeb">Two commenters provided different perspectives on the benefits of including top-account allocation information in the Discussion Document. One commenter emphasized that many benefits could only be achieved by requiring the reporting of primary market transactions at both the top-account and the subaccount allocation levels. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-5" NAME="fr_pz74-5">3075</a> In particular, the commenter maintained that because lead underwriters were responsible for the top-account allocations, some abuses, such as &#8220;spinning,&#8221; &#8220;laddering,&#8221; &#8220;quid pro quo,&#8221; Rule 105 violations, and manipulation, could only be present in these allocations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz74-6" NAME="fr_pz74-6">3076</a> Further, this commenter also stated that top-account information would facilitate analyses of the value of discretionary allocation in book-building for issuers. This commenter also indicated that final top-account allocations should be sufficient to achieve such benefits, while also indicating that information on the indications of interest was crucial for the understanding of the capital formation process and for designing efficient regulations that would facilitate capital formation without compromising investor protection.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAmMXV" NAME="fr_pAmMXV">3077</a> The other commenter believed that having only subaccount primary market allocation information is less valuable from a regulatory perspective than having both subaccount and top-account allocation information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-4" NAME="fr_pz75-4">3078</a></p>
          <p id="ac124405-cee1-4aab-be9d-2facec6dc104">The Commission received three comment letters relevant to the costs of including top-account allocation information in the Plan. All three commenters indicated that it would be very costly to include top-account allocations in the Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-5" NAME="fr_pz75-5">3079</a> but one commenter limited this conclusion just to the inclusion of indications of interest.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-6" NAME="fr_pz75-6">3080</a> According to the commenters, these costs generally stem from added complexity and a lack of standardization in book-building processes. Another commenter noted that top-account allocations would be less feasible to report than subaccount allocations and cited to information from the DAG.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-7" NAME="fr_pz75-7">3081</a> One commenter disagreed with the Plan&#8217;s cost estimates of $176 million for including top-account allocation information in the Plan and provided an alternative estimate of $864,000 per year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz75-8" NAME="fr_pz75-8">3082</a> Another commenter indicated that the Plan&#8217;s estimates amounted to guesswork and that the $176 million estimate in the Plan does not contemplate reporting all the events in a deal&#8217;s lifecycle, but does not indicate which events it does include.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAy_A" NAME="fr_pAy_A">3083</a></p>
          <p id="87313a21-c384-4294-9e5d-4ecb113f3ea1">Two commenters recommended additional analysis on some or all top-account allocation information, but neither specifically mentioned the Discussion Document. One commenter noted having little information about the requirements of reporting top-account allocation information and that subaccount allocation information is a good first step toward potentially collecting complete information on primary market activities that would allow time to study the complexities and difficulties associated with reporting top-account allocations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-3" NAME="fr_pz76-3">3084</a> This commenter also attempted a further study of more generally including primary market information in the Plan but noted that the 60-day comment period did not permit a larger, more in depth study.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-4" NAME="fr_pz76-4">3085</a> Another commenter suggested considering an alternate reporting scheme for indications of interest other than CAT that better balances the costs of producing data indications of interest but does not diminish the usefulness of such data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-5" NAME="fr_pz76-5">3086</a></p>
          <p id="ee9c8df2-5ae0-4a38-ab1e-170b2c45d601">In their response, the Participants reiterated their support for the inclusion in the CAT of subaccount allocations in Primary Market Transactions, but not top-account allocations, and reiterated the conclusions from the Plan that reporting top-account allocations would likely impose significant costs to CAT Reporters while only providing a marginal additional regulatory benefit over subaccount allocation data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz76-6" NAME="fr_pz76-6">3087</a> In response to comments regarding the scope of top-account allocation information, the Participants restated the definition in the Plan that top-account allocations are allocations to institutional clients or retail broker-dealers, which are conditional and may fluctuate until the offer syndicate terminates.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAROLr" NAME="fr_pAROLr">3088</a> The Participants did not respond to the comment that the cost estimates in the Plan do not contemplate reporting all events in a deal&#8217;s lifecycle and did not further discuss why top-account allocation information should not be included in the Discussion Document.</p>
          <p id="c7e544df-6f83-4a98-bf99-b0ac6884f56b">The Commission is revising its analysis of the economic effects of including top-account primary market transactions in the CAT and thus of whether top-account allocations should be included in the Discussion Document in light of comments and the Participants&#8217; response. With respect to the benefits of including top-account allocation information, in addition to subaccount allocation information, in the CAT, none of the commenters disagreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis. In fact, the Commission is expanding its analysis to include the additional benefits noted by one commenter that the Commission had not previously considered, namely better understanding the economics of the offering process and better identifying manipulative activities. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pABXM" NAME="fr_pABXM">3089</a> Further, the Participants&#8217; response provided no new information on why Participants believe top-account allocations provide only a marginal regulatory benefit over subaccount allocation data. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that top-account primary market allocation information would provide significant regulatory benefits.</p>
          <p id="f2199a5e-01da-42a5-abed-e621d22f9090">With respect to the costs of including top-account allocation information in the CAT, the Commission notes that the estimate of $864,000 per year provided by one of the commenters may not be comparable to the estimate of $176.1 million provided in the CAT NMS Plan. This is because the latter estimate reflects the implementation costs of adding top-account allocation information, while the former estimate seems to measure the ongoing annual costs to maintain the reporting.</p>
          <p id="3985162c-6704-4a63-9c92-3dcd7cb1052f">At the same time, the Commission believes that the commenter&#8217;s analysis of costs is consistent with the Commission&#8217;s analysis in the Notice in two respects. First, the commenter&#8217;s analysis is consistent with the Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusion that requiring less granular timestamps for reporting top-account allocation information would result in lower costs for top-account allocation information than indicated in the Plan. Second, the commenter&#8217;s estimate that reporting top-account allocation information would cost $864,000 per year in ongoing costs is consistent with the Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusion that the ongoing costs of reporting primary market transactions would be a fraction of the ongoing costs of secondary market reporting. Indeed, $864,000 per year represents a small fraction of the total ongoing annual cost of CAT, which the Commission estimates to be $1.7 billion per year.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz78-3" NAME="fr_pz78-3">3090</a></p>
          <p id="54783244-3089-4749-a72f-d7392023833e">With respect to the commenter who indicated that the cost estimates in the Plan did not contemplate indications of interest, the Commission notes that the Plan defines top-account allocations to include indications of interest&#8212;&#8220;conditional and may fluctuate until the offering syndicate terminates&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz78-4" NAME="fr_pz78-4">3091</a>&#8212;and suggests that its cost estimates for top-account allocations therefore include indications of interest. However, because this commenter conducted the study that provides the basis for the Plan&#8217;s cost estimate, the Commission believes that the commenter is correct and that the cost estimates in the Plan do not represent the costs of top-account allocations as defined in the Plan (i.e., the estimates do not cover indications of interest). That said, no comments directly disagreed with the reasons that the Commission provided in the Notice for why the Commission preliminarily believed the costs estimates in the Plan overstated the costs of including top-account allocation information in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz78-5" NAME="fr_pz78-5">3092</a> Therefore, in light of the comments, the Commission is less clear on the magnitude of the costs of including top-account allocation information in the Plan.</p>
          <p id="e5581efb-26ef-40cb-9733-b69e34f95457">In response to the commenters that indicated that additional analysis or consideration of including top-account allocation information in the Plan would be beneficial, the Commission notes that including this alternative in the Discussion Document provides an opportunity for this additional analysis and consideration. The Discussion Document will provide an outline of how the Participants could incorporate top-account allocation information into the CAT Data and include details for each order and Reportable Event that may be required to be provided, which market participants may be required to provide the data, the implementation timeline, and a cost estimate. Indeed, in addition to the commenters&#8217; suggestions for more study, the Commission believes that the information from commenters regarding the benefits of the different types of top-account allocation information, and the questions surrounding the cost estimates in the Plan, suggest that investors could benefit from the additional analysis that would be included in the Discussion Document.</p>

Further, not requiring these periodic refreshes could reduce the risk of a security breach of personally identifiable information. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believed that removing the requirements for periodic full refreshes of customer information could minimally reduce the cost of the Plan without materially reducing the benefits.</p>
          <p id="b7032073-d43f-42d7-a406-c9b4ba48e691">The Commission received two comments relevant to this alternative. One commenter suggested &#8220;having the functional support for a voluntary full refresh, but&#8230;eliminat[ing] the mandated requirement to provide full refreshes periodically,&#8221; and stated that, &#8220;the initial load, daily updates and standard error processing should be sufficient to maintain data integrity.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-3" NAME="fr_pz80-3">3094</a> That commenter went on to state that it &#8220;may be easier to define all active customers to CAT, or just active customers who have transacted in NMS securities.&#8221; The commenter stated that removing the requirement may &#8220;only slightly reduce the burden or cost,&#8221; although it would improve the overall security of the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-4" NAME="fr_pz80-4">3095</a> Another commenter stated their belief that, &#8220;periodic refreshes of all customer information to the Central Repository is a bad idea.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-5" NAME="fr_pz80-5">3096</a> In their response, the Participants stated that they believe that a periodic refresh of customer information is beneficial because it will help to ensure that all customer information remains accurate and up to date.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-6" NAME="fr_pz80-6">3097</a> The Participants noted the provisions in the Plan with respect to information security.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz80-7" NAME="fr_pz80-7">3098</a> The Participants also noted that the Plan provides that the Participants will define the scope of what constitutes a &#8220;full&#8221; customer information refresh with the assistance of the Plan Processor to determine the extent to which inactive or other accounts would need to be reported.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pANi2" NAME="fr_pANi2">3099</a></p>
          <p id="41cd5933-efb1-4334-a3f0-8112e6ade4fa">The Commission has considered the comments and the Participants&#8217; response and continues to believe that removing the requirements for periodic full refreshes of customer information could minimally reduce the cost of the Plan without materially reducing the benefits. Specifically, the Commission agrees that allowing market participants to periodically refresh their customer information but dropping the requirement that they refresh it regularly would reduce costs to broker-dealers because broker-dealers could choose to do a refresh when they believe a full refresh would be more cost effective than editing individual records, while not requiring them to do a refresh when they believe their customer information stored in the Central Repository is accurate. Having a full refresh as an option would save broker-dealers the costs associated with running a refresh procedure when it is not needed, but allowing it when it is efficient for the broker-dealer to update its customer information in this manner. The Commission disagrees with the comment that periodic refreshes are a &#8220;bad idea&#8221; in general. As discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA9mzP" NAME="fr_pA9mzP">3100</a> the Commission recognizes that periodic refreshes introduce an opportunity for correct data in the Central Repository to be replaced by incorrect data due to a problem in the refresh procedure. However, the Commission also believes that periodic refreshes provide an opportunity for incorrect information in the Central Repository to be replaced with correct information. The Commission does not have information to estimate whether the former outcome is more likely than the latter, because it lacks information on the proportion of customer information records that are errant in existing databases in industry and the likelihood that data refresh procedures introduce incorrect data, and commenters did not provide this information. The Commission notes that the Participants&#8217; response does not address whether the periodic refreshes would be redundant, or why submitting the redundant information would be beneficial. However, the Commission acknowledges that, as set out in the Participants&#8217; response, the Plan provides that the Participants will work with the Plan Processor to determine the extent to which inactive or other accounts would need to be reported,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-6" NAME="fr_pz82-6">3101</a> which may reduce the costs of the periodic refresh by reducing the number of accounts to which it applies.</p>

          <p id="7ca7f9ef-fbcc-4662-90a6-07cbabf33859">Several commenters discussed the Plan&#8217;s treatment of bulk data downloads by CAT Reporters. Specifically, some commenters suggested that CAT Reporters should be allowed to access and export the data they report to the Central Repository. The Commission has considered the potential economic effects of that alternative approach, as discussed below.</p>
          <p id="2e2800ab-601d-4235-b11d-2880c372ebe6">Several commenters suggested that the Plan permit CAT Reporters to access their own CAT Data through bulk data exports. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-7" NAME="fr_pz82-7">3102</a> Another commenter stated that permitting CAT Reporters to download their own data from the Central Repository will provide benefits such as improved CAT reporting error rates and improved ability to meet regulatory, surveillance, and compliance requirements.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-8" NAME="fr_pz82-8">3103</a> One commenter suggested that independent software vendors be permitted to access the CAT Data on behalf of their clients.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-9" NAME="fr_pz82-9">3104</a> However, several commenters expressed strong concerns about allowing any entity to extract or download data from the Central Repository, suggesting that the risk of a data breach would greatly increase as the data are maintained at more sites.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz82-10" NAME="fr_pz82-10">3105</a> Commenters also suggested that the risk increases when those entities downloading the data may have technology systems that are not subject to the same high security requirements at the Plan Processor.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-4" NAME="fr_pz83-4">3106</a></p>
          <p id="05094206-833e-48f9-84e6-8e0dee577789">In their response, the Participants stated that they believe that there may be merit to providing Industry Member CAT Reporters and their vendors with bulk access to the CAT Reporters&#8217; own unlinked CAT Data, but noted that such access also raises a variety of operational, security, cost and other issues related to the CAT. The Participants stated that they will consider this issue once the CAT is operational.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-5" NAME="fr_pz83-5">3107</a></p>
          <p id="97a53bc5-69b8-420d-9bfd-e64b43158d46">Currently, the CAT NMS Plan states that, initially, CAT Reporters will not have access to their data submissions through bulk data extracts.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz83-6" NAME="fr_pz83-6">3108</a> The Commission agrees with commenters that an alternative approach that specified that CAT Reporters will be allowed to make bulk extractions of their own data from the Central Repository would help CAT Reporters correct errors and respond to regulatory inquiries. Specifically, the Commission believes that, by querying and analyzing the full set of data submitted to the CAT, as opposed to viewing only the errors, CAT Reporters may be able to better diagnose a problem that could be system-wide. This could facilitate corrections to the process that CAT reporters use to record and report order events to prevent future errors. The Commission also recognizes that there may be benefits to internal surveillance regarding compliance, tracking regulatory submissions by third parties, and CAT Reporter recordkeeping.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAaJc" NAME="fr_pAaJc">3109</a> The Commission believes this could have benefits in terms of increasing the accuracy and timeliness of the CAT Data by allowing errors to be corrected faster and more effectively, and by possibly reducing reporting costs for some entities by making the error correction process easier and more efficient and eliminating the need for CAT Reporters to store the data they submit on their own systems.</p>
          <p id="176eb242-3e00-4818-8f15-ddeef6369ca5">However, the Commission notes that, under the Plan, CAT Reporters will be able to view their submissions online in a read-only, non-exportable format, which will facilitate error identification and correction.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz84-3" NAME="fr_pz84-3">3110</a> Commenters did not provide sufficient information to allow the Commission to assess the magnitude of the potential benefits of allowing bulk data exports in addition to read-only access,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz84-4" NAME="fr_pz84-4">3111</a> and the Commission believes they may be modest. The Commission also notes that, to the extent CAT Reporters retain copies of their submissions, they may be able to refer to that data when correcting errors and responding to regulatory inquiries. Further, the Commission also agrees with commenters and the Participants that allowing CAT Reporters to engage in bulk data exports, even if limited to their own reported data, could increase the risk of a data breach insofar as it increases the number of systems that have access to the CAT Central Repository. As discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAiMSA" NAME="fr_pAiMSA">3112</a> while uncertain, the costs of a security breach could be significant. The Commission recognizes that some CAT Reporters that would be downloading bulk data might already have access to the Central Repository in order to upload their data, but it notes that many may not, because their data may be reported by one or more third parties. The Commission notes that it is difficult to determine the magnitude by which the risk of a breach would increase, because many of the decisions that define security measures for the Central Repository are coincident with the selection of the Plan Processor, and there is considerable diversity in the potential security approaches of the Bidders. The Commission notes that the Participants state that they will reconsider the issue once the CAT is operational.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz85-6" NAME="fr_pz85-6">3113</a></p>

          <p id="a2e339ed-2afb-40c4-9db6-e63c10e8d996">The Commission discussed how, as one alternative to the CAT NMS Plan, it could require modifications to OATS. However, the Commission also noted that OATS would require significant modifications in order to provide the attributes that the Commission deems crucial for an effective audit trail. Furthermore, the Commission indicated that any OATS-based alternative to CAT that did not provide these attributes would limit the potential benefits of the alternative significantly.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAH-L" NAME="fr_pAH-L">3115</a></p>
          <p id="a2d240de-5799-4572-9444-536d9cede2bb">The Commission acknowledged that it does not have sufficient information to estimate the potential cost savings, if any, from mandating an OATS-based approach as an alternative to the CAT NMS Plan. However, the Commission noted that <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> provided flexibility to the SROs to propose an approach based on OATS and that the SROs could have utilized an OATS-based approach if that approach had represented significant cost savings relative to the Plan&#8217;s approach.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz86-5" NAME="fr_pz86-5">3116</a></p>
          <p id="827a0659-62f0-44e2-a001-0c9797790cbf">In the Notice, the Commission discussed another alternative, which would be for the Commission to modify other data sources instead of, or in combination with, OATS. However, the Commission also noted that like OATS, all of the current data sources have limitations that would need to be addressed in order to provide the attributes that the Commission deems crucial to an effective audit trail. Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily believed that modifying any other single data source would be more costly than modifying OATS while adopting an alternative to the CAT NMS Plan that relied on multiple data sources &#8230; would eliminate the benefits associated with having a single complete consolidated source from which regulators can access trade and order data, which the Commission considers to be very significant.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz86-6" NAME="fr_pz86-6">3117</a></p>
          <p id="4f92abf2-b731-4bc0-a328-d0aebd0c0c90">Overall, the Commission preliminarily believed that mandating improvements to the completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of current data sources without an NMS Plan that requires the consolidation of data and increased coverage across markets and broker-dealers would likely significantly limit the potential benefits relative to the Plan, possibly without providing significant cost savings.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pATp3" NAME="fr_pATp3">3118</a></p>
          <p id="4c9fc462-5c14-42eb-aea9-aa2f57307382">The Commission received one comment on the possibility of requiring modifications to OATS as an alternative to the CAT NMS Plan. The commenter agreed with the Commission&#8217;s analysis and the CAT NMS Plan approach, noting that &#8220;the vision of CAT has evolved through the years to become a much more comprehensive system than OATS or any other current system&#8221; and that &#8220;there is an opportunity now to take advantage of new technologies and the associated cost benefits they provide.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz87-3" NAME="fr_pz87-3">3119</a> Another commenter suggested an alternate approach to the CAT NMS Plan where the Commission would host the system in-house, under its direct and sole control, retaining the prerogative to grant (or deny) access to the data to non-broker-dealer affiliated SROs.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz87-4" NAME="fr_pz87-4">3120</a> The commenter believed that collecting the data pursuant to an NMS Plan providing for SRO ownership, management and control over the data would limit the benefits of the Plan by potentially limiting the Commission&#8217;s access to, and use of, CAT Data.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz87-5" NAME="fr_pz87-5">3121</a></p>
          <p id="dab8c505-7887-4826-bc37-783a7b34836a">The Commission has considered the comments and continues to believe that mandating improvements to the completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of current data sources without an NMS Plan that requires the consolidation of data and increased coverage across markets and broker-dealers would likely significantly limit the potential benefits, possibly without providing significant cost savings. In response to the suggestion that the Commission host the system in-house, the Commission believes that the concerns expressed by the commenter with respect to the Commission&#8217;s ability to access and utilize the CAT Data are mitigated by the Commission&#8217;s direct oversight authority with respect to the CAT NMS Plan, including but not limited to its ability to observe all meetings, including those conducted in Executive Session, its review and approval of rule changes, and its examination and inspection authority over the SROs. Further, as discussed above,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz88-4" NAME="fr_pz88-4">3122</a> SROs have specific obligations under the Exchange Act as front-line regulators of the securities markets, and accordingly are well-positioned to oversee the development and operation of the CAT in a manner that will best fulfill regulatory needs, subject to oversight by the Commission. The Commission therefore does not agree that an alternative to the CAT NMS Plan where the Commission hosted the system in-house would result in greater benefits as compared to the CAT NMS Plan approach.</p>

One commenter suggested that mandating the storage method would &#8220;make the structure too rigid and static, hindering the flexibility for future scalability.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz91-4" NAME="fr_pz91-4">3134</a> Another commenter claimed too little information in that the &#8220;eventual Plan Processor is in a better position to define the storage methods&#8221; stating that evaluation considers &#8220;total system design, not storage methods in isolation.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz91-5" NAME="fr_pz91-5">3135</a> The third commenter did not provide arguments supporting its recommendation, but did point out that the method of storage would allow the ability to return results of queries at varying time intervals.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz91-6" NAME="fr_pz91-6">3136</a> The commenters did not discuss the relative costs and benefits of the specific architectures mentioned in the Plan but one commenter indicated that its own system could enable ultrafast analysis/ pattern recognition and save significant space.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAc_3" NAME="fr_pAc_3">3137</a> Based on these comments, the Commission believes that mandating a particular storage method could be costly, but Commission did not receive comments on the benefits of mandating a storage method or on the costs or benefits of particular storage methods. Therefore, the Commission has more information than at the time of the Notice regarding the costs of mandating a particular storage method but still cannot fully analyze the economic effects.</p>

          <p id="2976ac5a-5c6d-42ab-89ce-35801c3efd05">In the Notice, the Commission requested comment on whether the Plan should mandate a particular approach to data ingestion.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz92-4" NAME="fr_pz92-4">3138</a> The CAT NMS Plan does not mandate the format in which data must be reported to the Central Repository.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AkC9" NAME="fr_AkC9">3139</a> Rather, the Plan provides that the Plan Processor will determine the electronic format in which data must be reported, and that the format will be described in the Technical Specifications.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AEn7m" NAME="fr_AEn7m">3140</a> The Plan discusses the tradeoffs between requiring that the CAT Reporters report data to CAT in a uniform defined format, in existing messaging protocols, or a hybrid of both.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AD7k" NAME="fr_AD7k">3141</a> The Plan does not require any approach, but will determine the approach in conjunction with the selection of the Plan Processor. An example of a uniform defined format includes the current process for reporting data to OATS.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_A9-n" NAME="fr_A9-n">3142</a> Several bidders proposed to leverage the OATS format and enhance it to meet the requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. The Plan states that this could reduce the burden on certain CAT Reporters (i.e., current OATS Reporters) and simplify the process for those CAT Reporters to implement the CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_AfhMv" NAME="fr_AfhMv">3143</a> The other alternative, accepting existing messaging protocols, would allow CAT Reporters to submit copies of their order handling messages that are typically used across the order lifecycle and within order management processes, such as FIX. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-5" NAME="fr_pz93-5">3144</a> The Plan states that using existing messaging protocols could result in quicker implementation times and simplify data aggregation.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-6" NAME="fr_pz93-6">3145</a> The Plan further notes that surveys revealed no cost difference between the two approaches,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-7" NAME="fr_pz93-7">3146</a> but that FIF members prefer using the FIX protocol.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-8" NAME="fr_pz93-8">3147</a></p>
          <p id="72bc582f-d28c-4d36-bf58-4de3da82e7c5">While the Plan discussed a &#8220;uniform defined format&#8221; as different from existing messaging protocols such as FIX, the Commission understands that the term &#8220;uniform defined format&#8221; can also apply to FIX. To clarify the distinction between the two approaches, the Commission refers to one approach as requiring a &#8220;specialized delimited flat file&#8221; approach and the other as requiring existing messaging protocols.</p>
          <p id="efb52bc6-81a5-41a2-8d9f-a93c6285e108">In addition to soliciting comment on whether the Plan should mandate an approach, the Commission also requested information on the relative costs and benefits, including implementation and ongoing costs of the data ingestion format approaches.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-9" NAME="fr_pz93-9">3148</a> Further, the Commission noted that the survey results that the costs of the approaches are similar did not seem intuitive and requested comment on why the costs appear similar in the survey results.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-10" NAME="fr_pz93-10">3149</a></p>
          <p id="67a178ba-bf54-4403-ae7b-1b0bef050292">As an alternative to the Plan, four commenters seemed to support specifying an approach to data ingestion format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz93-11" NAME="fr_pz93-11">3150</a> One commenter stated that mandating an approach in the Plan would give industry more time to prepare and would limit the chances that broker-dealers would need to make significant changes after seeing the Technical Specifications, which could seriously compromise the implementation schedule.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-4" NAME="fr_pz94-4">3151</a> In particular, this commenter stated that the data ingestion format approach is a critical component of the Plan and &#8220;an optimum solution that meets the needs of industry at reasonable cost and is minimally disruptive&#8221; would require that the approach be &#8220;widely reviewed and vetted across the industry.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-5" NAME="fr_pz94-5">3152</a> Another commenter suggested mandating the approach for consistency and transparency.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-6" NAME="fr_pz94-6">3153</a> The other two commenters that supported mandating the approach in the Plan provided arguments regarding the effects of a specific approach but not the effects of mandating an approach.</p>
          <p id="66518320-213a-413c-82f0-8e5a923ac3d0">Another alternative would be to specify the actual format in the Plan. Of the four commenters who supported mandating the approach, one also supported mandating the format in the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-7" NAME="fr_pz94-7">3154</a></p>
          <p id="d668085f-f1e0-4aae-a544-266406181460">Six commenters provided information on the tradeoffs or economic effects of various approaches or formats.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-8" NAME="fr_pz94-8">3155</a> While some commenters addressed the alternatives of a specialized delimited flat file such as a modified OATS, existing messaging protocol such as FIX, or a hybrid of the two,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz94-9" NAME="fr_pz94-9">3156</a> others commented more generally on the impacts of non-uniform formats or standards without indicating whether they consider a messaging protocol to be non-uniform or uniform format or standard.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-3" NAME="fr_pz95-3">3157</a> Only one commenter specifically addressed why the costs of reporting using Plan-mandated messaging protocols would be similar to reporting in a specialized delimited flat file format, and that commenter asserted that the costs should be the same for either approach because accepting existing message protocols would require a more expensive infrastructure and the cost would likely be passed down to the CAT Reporters.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-4" NAME="fr_pz95-4">3158</a> The six commenters also provided mixed information on the economic effects of various considerations, <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-5" NAME="fr_pz95-5">3159</a> such as accepting multiple formats or a single format,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-6" NAME="fr_pz95-6">3160</a> and accepting only widely used existing formats, new specialized delimited flat file formats, or existing bespoke broker-dealer formats. <a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-7" NAME="fr_pz95-7">3161</a></p>
          <p id="c8cb1f24-503e-4c6d-8ac6-c079102d8819">In response to comments, the Participants explained that they continue to believe that the Plan should not mandate a specific message format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz95-8" NAME="fr_pz95-8">3162</a> That said, the Participants understand that the message format used for reporting to the Central Repository must be easily understood and adopted by the industry, and this factor will be considered as the Participants evaluate each Bidder&#8217;s solution. Moreover, the Participants also will take into consideration that the Plan Processor must be able to reliably and accurately convert data to a uniform electronic format for consolidation and storage, regardless of the message formats in which the CAT Reporters would be required to report data to the Central Repository. The message format(s) ultimately selected for reporting to the Central Repository will be described in the Technical Specifications, which will be approved by the Operating Committee. In addition, the Participants indicated that the Bids of the three remaining Bidders propose accepting existing messaging protocols (e.g., FIX), rather than requiring CAT Reporters to use a new format.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAFLM" NAME="fr_pAFLM">3163</a></p>
          <p id="f9cd7a2a-9f77-4072-9eaf-227699039a98">The Commission has considered the comments and Participants&#8217; responses in relation to whether the Plan should mandate a specific approach and believes that there are certain costs and benefits associated with mandating the approach in the Plan and that not mandating the approach is a source of uncertainty in assessing the economic effects of the Plan. The Commission believes that the risks to the implementation schedule (and therefore an increase in implementation costs) of not mandating an approach would be lower if CAT Reporters could submit their reports to CAT in the message protocols they currently use for business purposes because such implementation would involve updating current systems rather than building new systems. The Commission understands from the Participants&#8217; response that all remaining Bidders would have within the Plan Processor the ability to accept existing message protocols. Therefore, those CAT Reporters currently using the messaging protocols accepted by the eventual Plan Processor would not need to make significant systems changes. However, the Commission recognizes that the mixed information regarding the economic effects of particular approaches or formats reflects the level of uncertainty in the range of benefits and costs associated with the selection of data ingestion formats and thus the impact of the lack of transparency in the Plan on this economic analysis.</p>
          <p id="aa822f66-bcc1-48f4-b6c6-bc05cfae1617">In response to the comment that the costs of the two approaches should be similar, the Commission notes that the costs of the approaches do not seem consistent with the comment. Whereas the commenter&#8217;s statements would suggest that the costs of message protocols would be lower for broker-dealers, vendors, and SROs, and higher for building and operating the Central Repository, and similar in aggregate, the costs actually appear similar for each survey group. Therefore, the Commission continues to recognize that the survey result indicating that the costs of the approaches are similar does not seem intuitive.</p>
          <p id="a324e037-a4be-4b3e-8e38-19b9fa461c7f">Finally, the Commission notes the potential for the Plan Processor to use the opportunity to select a message format that entrenches itself by increasing the costs of replacement due to underperformance.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz97-6" NAME="fr_pz97-6">3164</a> However, as explained above and in <a href="#16b6a7a0-2824-4fd6-b5a8-07a58dbe2a2e">Section IV.D.2</a> the Participants will consider whether a Bidder has proposed a format that is easily understood and adoptable by the industry, and the Commission believes that the message format decision must be made in connection with developing the overall architecture for CAT.</p>
          <p id="a54ad1eb-6346-42b7-8323-5e26f17763b4">c. Process to Develop CAT</p>
          <p id="2e118978-f704-4d6a-8f0a-a76a3c3c97ad">In the Notice, the Commission requested comment on whether the CAT NMS Plan should mandate a particular development process and the impact on the relative costs and benefits of particular processes.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_Ak73" NAME="fr_Ak73">3165</a> Bidders proposed, and the Plan describes, several processes for development of the CAT: the agile or iterative development model, the waterfall model, and hybrid models.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-3" NAME="fr_pz98-3">3166</a> The CAT NMS Plan does not mandate a particular development process because any of the options could be utilized to manage the development of CAT.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-4" NAME="fr_pz98-4">3167</a> The CAT NMS Plan notes that the agile model is more flexible and more susceptible to the early delivery of software for testing and feedback, but that the agile model makes it more difficult to accurately estimate the effort and time required for development. The waterfall model would also facilitate longer-term planning and coordination among multiple vendors or project streams.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-5" NAME="fr_pz98-5">3168</a></p>
          <p id="a5efcd78-dcb2-4f3f-902a-a625453dc13d">Two commenters suggested that the Plan not mandate a particular development method.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-6" NAME="fr_pz98-6">3169</a> One commenter stated that &#8220;appropriate management flexibilities/discretions are needed.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz98-7" NAME="fr_pz98-7">3170</a> The other commenter cited bidder expertise and that the Plan Processor should be allowed to choose the &#8220;methodology most appropriate for the specific development effort.&#8221;<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pAvqT" NAME="fr_pAvqT">3171</a> The commenter continued on to say that &#8220;the different development methodologies can each be equally effective in an implementation plan, depending on many factors and tradeoffs.&#8221; While providing information on the costs of mandating a method, neither provided relative costs and benefits of specific methods.</p>
          <p id="aa49fdcf-f916-454f-8361-5913b7f7cd53">Based on these comments, the Commission believes that mandating a specific development process in the Plan could be costly because mandating the process removes the ability for the Plan Processor to select the lowest cost or most effective methodology for a given implementation. The Commission recognizes that the Plan will involve one big implementation initially, but may also involve many subsequent implementations based on amendments to the Plan or changes in the technical specifications. The nature of these implementations could vary greatly and the same development methodology may not be most effective in all situations. Therefore, the Commission recognizes that mandating a specific development process would be costly.</p>

          <p id="3545d14f-36e1-441b-a13b-a79894c3b4ed">In the Notice, the Commission requested comment on whether the CAT NMS Plan should specify the standards for user support and on the relative costs and benefits of the alternative standards.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-5" NAME="fr_pz99-5">3172</a> The CAT NMS Plan discusses several alternatives related to how the Plan Processor provides a CAT help desk that would be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and be able to manage 2,500 calls per month.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-6" NAME="fr_pz99-6">3173</a> Specifically, alternatives relate to the number of user support staff members, the degree to which the support team is dedicated to CAT, and whether the help desk is located in the United States or offshore. The CAT NMS Plan discusses the benefit and cost tradeoffs,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz99-7" NAME="fr_pz99-7">3174</a> but does not mandate any of the particular alternatives. Instead, the CAT NMS Plan commits to considering each Bidder&#8217;s user support proposals in the context of the overall Bid.</p>
          <p id="29cb5930-f4f6-4e25-92de-071b459176d9">Two commenters addressed alternatives regarding user support and a help desk.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-5" NAME="fr_pz100-5">3175</a> One commenter recommended that customer support guidelines and functionalities be specified in the Plan<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-6" NAME="fr_pz100-6">3176</a> while the other suggested that the costs of user support and a help desk could be &#8220;minimized or eliminated&#8221; under different data collection and reporting methods.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz100-7" NAME="fr_pz100-7">3177</a> The commenter that supported specifying guidelines and functionalities in the Plan stated that &#8220;the level of service provided is directly tied to the industry&#8217;s ability to meet the aggressive quality goals and error rates, and directly tied to customer service costs in bidders&#8217; proposals, and ultimately in costs to be borne by the industry.&#8221; Therefore, the commenter said they &#8220;should be dictated by the Plan and not left to Plan Processor discretion.&#8221; Rather than focus on the size and location of the support team and whether the team is dedicated to CAT, the commenter suggests specific standards and functionalities such as wait times, a tracking system, and the ability for web submission or &#8220;on-line chat.&#8221;</p>
          <p id="f2671d0b-1e27-472e-8f59-8b59a7b9b72a">In their response, the Participants clarified that the CAT Help Desk staff will be trained to support CAT Reporters as needed, and noted that this may include, for example, training related to data access tools, data submission requirements, and customer support.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pA27q" NAME="fr_pA27q">3178</a></p>
          <p id="4794ee58-31a7-4aa5-a50e-29e943bac25a">The Commission has considered these comments and recognizes the benefits of the Plan specifying certain functionalities and standards while letting the Plan Processor select the size and location of the support team necessary to meet these functionalities and standards. In particular, the Commission agrees with the commenter that specifying guidelines and functionalities can facilitate the accomplishment of the benefits described herein and could result in lower costs to the industry relative to the Plan. However, the Commission also agrees that the Plan Processor may be in a better position to determine the size and location of the support team needed to satisfy the guidelines and functionalities.</p>

The Commission acknowledges, however, that there are some broker-dealers that would be classified as Outsourcers or new reporters and the additional implementation costs that these firms face due to clearing for other broker-dealers or supporting introducing broker-dealers are not captured by the Outsourcing Cost Model. The Commission cannot estimate the number of broker-dealers that would bear these costs because the Commission lacks data on the number of broker-dealers that clear for other broker-dealers that would be classified as new reporters or Outsourcers. Furthermore, the Commission lacks data to estimate the magnitude of these costs because the Plan does not provide this data and the Commission is unaware of any data available to it that it could use to estimate these costs.</p>

The Commission also notes that final Bids will not be submitted until after the Plan is approved, so the Commission is unable to quantify the degree of variation in broker-dealer implementation costs across Bids.</p>

Although the Commission believes this will reduce the compliance costs for broker-dealers, Participants, and the Central Repository, the Commission cannot quantify the savings and is thus not amending its external cost estimates in response to commenters.</p>
          <p id="83bf65c7-781d-44c5-a37a-c6dbe1665914">The Participants&#8217; statement that open/close indicators are not reported on some options orders is consistent with the Commission&#8217;s experience and the analysis in the Notice. While the economic analysis in the Notice did not explicitly separate the costs associated with an open/close indicator for equities and an open/close indicator for options, the Commission believes that the costs of the open/close indicator for options are included in the cost estimates of the Notice. However, because the Plan will no longer require the reporting of the open/close indicator for Options Market Maker quotations, the Commission now believes there will be an additional cost savings associated with not having to report this indicator as part of CAT.</p>

One commenter expressed concern that use of a tiered-fees structure could discourage the display of quotes. In response the Participants explained that one of the reasons they chose to use a tiered-fee funding model was to limit disincentives to providing liquidity. To help determine whether the Plan&#8217;s funding model actually achieves the Participants&#8217; stated objective, the Commission believes it is appropriate to require them to provide this assessment. The Commission believes that a report that explains the observed impact on liquidity after reporting begins will allow the Commission and the Participants to determine whether or not the tier-fee structure discourages Industry Member from providing liquidity.</p>

      <p>11 Completeness refers to whether a data source represents all market activity of interest to regulators, and whether the data is sufficiently detailed to provide the information regulators require. While current data sources provide the trade and order data required by existing rules and regulations, those sources generally do not provide all of the information of interest to regulators in one consolidated audit trail. Accuracy refers to whether the data about a particular order or trade is correct and reliable. Accessibility refers to how the data is stored, how practical it is to assemble, aggregate, and process the data, and whether all appropriate regulators could acquire the data they need. Timeliness refers to when the data is available to regulators and how long it would take to process before it could be used for regulatory analysis. See Adopting Release, infra note 14, at 45727.</p>

      <p>12 The Commission notes that the SROs have taken steps in recent years to update their audit trail requirements. For example, NYSE, NYSE Amex LLC (n/k/a &#8220;NYSE MKT LLC&#8221;) (&#8220;NYSE Amex&#8221;), and NYSE ARCA, Inc. (&#8220;NYSE Arca&#8221;) have adopted audit trail rules that coordinate with FINRA&#8217;s Order Audit Trail System (&#8220;OATS&#8221;) requirements. See <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2011/34-65523.pdf">Securities Exchange Act Release No. 65523</a> (October 7, 2011), <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/10/17/2011-26670/self-regulatory-organizations-new-york-stock-exchange-llc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate">76 FR 64154</a> (October 17, 2011) (concerning NYSE); <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyseamex/2011/34-65524.pdf">Securities Exchange Act Release No. 65524</a> (October 7, 2011), <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/10/17/2011-26671/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-amex-llc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed">76 FR 64151</a> (October 17, 2011) (concerning NYSE Amex); <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2011/34-65544.pdf">Securities Exchange Act Release No. 65544</a> (October 12, 2011), <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/10/18/2011-26858/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-proposed">76 FR 64406</a> (October 18, 2011) (concerning NYSE Arca). This allows the SROs to submit their data to FINRA pursuant to a Regulatory Service Agreement (&#8220;RSA&#8221;), which FINRA can then reformat and combine with OATS data. Despite these efforts, however, significant deficiencies remain. See Notice, supra note 5, at <a href="#16b6a7a0-2824-4fd6-b5a8-07a58dbe2a2e">Section IV.D.2.b</a>.</p>

      <p>402 The CAT NMS Plan states that the Participants anticipate that Customer information that is initially reported to the CAT could be limited to Customer accounts that have, or are expected to have, CAT Reportable Event activity. For example, the CAT NMS Plan notes accounts that are considered open, but have not traded Eligible Securities in a given time frame, may not need to be pre-established in the CAT, but rather could be reported as part of daily updates after they have CAT Reportable Event activity.

      <p>406 The CAT NMS Plan notes that because reporting to the CAT is on an end-of-day basis, intra-day changes to information could be captured as part of the daily updates to the information. To ensure the completeness and accuracy of Customer information and associations, in addition to daily updates, broker-dealers would be required to submit periodic full refreshes of Customer information to the CAT. The scope of the &#8220;full&#8221; Customer information refresh would need to be further defined, with the assistance of the Plan Processor, to determine the extent to which inactive or otherwise terminated accounts would need to be reported.

Section 11 of Appendix D sets out the obligations of the Plan Processor with respect to the requirements discussed above (e.g., to develop a process to add functionality to CAT, including reviewing suggestions submitted by the Commission). The Plan Processor must create a defined process for developing impact assessments, including implementation timelines for proposed changes, and a mechanism by which functional changes that the Plan Processor wishes to undertake could be reviewed and approved by the Operating Committee. Section 11 further states that the Plan Processor must implement a process to govern changes to CAT (including &#8220;business-as-usual&#8221; changes and isolated infrastructure changes). Further, Section 11 states that the Plan Processor is required to implement a process governing user testing of changes to CAT functionality and infrastructure. See id. at Appendix D, Section 11.</p>

The Commission also notes that although the commenter did not include the EMSAC&#8217;s rationale for the reallocation of voting rights recommendation, in the EMSAC Recommendations cited by the commenter, the EMSAC explained that it recommended reallocating voting rights because the &#8220;reallocation of voting rights [among NMS plan participants] is intended to better reflect the proportional interests of NMS [p]lan participants&#8221;).

      <p>765 As previously stated, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the CAT NMS Plan to include a governance structure similar to that utilized by other NMS plans that the Commission previously has found to be consistent with the Act. As with the comments regarding the Operating Committee, some of the suggestions made by commenters regarding the Advisory Committee are mirrored in the EMSAC recommendations. As already discussed, the Commission is separately reviewing these EMSAC recommendations. See supra note 693.</p>

      <p>845 ICI Letter at 13; FIX Trading Letter at 1&#8211;2; Data Boiler Letter at 41; FIF Letter at 91. FIF stated that CAT Reporters could use either an existing format or a &#8220;native&#8221; format developed by the Plan Processor. Another commenter was against trying to develop a native CAT format. Data Boiler Letter at 20. This commenter suggested preserving data in its most original format and then converting trade streams into &#8220;music formats&#8221; for ease of storage and comparison and to facilitate surveillance.

      <p>869 Id. at 1. This commenter suggested that if CAT Data was going to be reported in real-time, SIP data should also be reported in real-time. See Data Boiler Letter at 42. Because the Commission does not believe that real-time reporting should be mandated by the Plan, the commenter&#8217;s suggestion that SIP data be reported in real-time if CAT Data is going to be reported in real-time, is moot.</p>

      <p>969 According to the Participants, requiring the reporting of unique CAT-Reporter-IDs of: (i) the Industry Member receiving or originating an order; (ii) the Industry Member or Participant from which (and to which) an order is being routed; (iii) the Industry Member or Participant receiving (and routing) a routed order; (iv) the Industry Member or Participant executing an order; and (v) the clearing broker or prime broker, would have imposed technical implementation difficulties on CAT Reporters and the Plan Processor alike to adopt the infrastructure to comply with the reporting, collection, and maintenance of CAT-Reporter-IDs. See Exemptive Request Letter, supra note 21, at 26. The Commission has considered the economic implications of the exemptive relief permitting the Existing Identifier Approach, as well as the other approaches in the CAT NMS Plan (options market maker quotes, Customer-ID, linking of executions to specific subaccount allocations on Allocation Reports, and timestamp granularity for Manual Order Events) that required exemptive relief from <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> for inclusion in its economic analysis.

In support of its objection to including a timestamp in the Allocation Report, this commenter explained that, to detect wrongdoing in the collection process, one could compare the average execution price on the allocation to the market price when the allocation was submitted.

      <p>1010 The Commission does not believe that the alternative suggested by one commenter, comparing the average execution price on the allocation to the market price when the allocation was submitted and looking for excess profits and losses, would be nearly as effective, given that the time of the actual allocation would not be available.</p>

      <p>1102 The Commission notes that, in contrast to the Participants&#8217; response, the Commission is amending the Plan without limitation to only &#8220;relevant standards&#8221; because the Commission believes that the NIST Cyber Security Framework already provides flexibility to ensure only relevant standards apply, and without specific reference to NIST 800-53 or ISO 27001. The Commission also is amending Appendix D, Section 4.2 of the Plan to clarify that the listed industry standards are not intended to be an exclusive list. The Commission believes this amendment is appropriate to clarify that the Participants may adhere to additional industry standards.</p>

This commenter also generally recommended automatic deactivation for users who do not access CAT for a specified period of time (e.g., 6 months), or whose access is not re&#8211;confirmed by the entity who employs the person requesting CAT Data, or whose firm account has been deactivated. Additionally, the commenter stated that email addresses for CAT users should be immutable and should allow for change via administrative review workflow, and shared user IDs should be prohibited.

      <p>1279 A comment from one Participant suggested that persons with access to the Central Repository&#8212;regardless of whether they are employed by the Plan Processor, the Commission, or a Participant&#8212;should not be subject to personal liability for the misuse of data. The Commission is not amending the Plan to remove personal liability from all categories of such persons. The inclusion in the Plan of a provision providing for personal liability for the misuse of data indicates that the Participants more broadly believe that this is an appropriate and potentially effective way of deterring misuse of data, including by their own employees. And, in the Commission&#8217;s view, the Participants&#8217; belief is reasonable.</p>

      <p>1513 Response Letter I, at 45&#8211;46. This analysis considered the initial error rates for reporting by market participants that were reporting audit trail information to OATS for the first time, and assumed a similar learning curve would be experienced by CAT Reporters who have not previously reported audit trail information, such as options market participants.</p>

      <p>1516 Participants have considered the industry&#8217;s experience with the OATS system over the last 10 years, including three significant additions to OATS: (1) requirement that manual orders be reported to OATS; (2) requirement that OTC Equity Securities be reported to OATS; and (3) requirement that all NMS stocks be reported to OATS. Each of these changes resulted in significant updates to the required formats which required OATS reporters to update and test their reporting systems and infrastructure.

      <p>1527 SIFMA Letter at 6&#8211;7, UnaVista Letter at 4. One commenter also stated that small broker-dealers should not be excused from error rate requirements if they begin reporting voluntarily at the same time large broker-dealers begin reporting. This commenter argued that if small broker-dealers are permitted to report to CAT with limitless errors during the phase designed for large broker-dealers to report without being subject to an error rate, the utility of CAT will be diminished. See Better Markets Letter at 9. The Commission believes that a maximum Error Rate would apply to anyone reporting to CAT, whether mandated to do so to be in accordance with the CAT NMS Plan or voluntarily.</p>

      <p>1534 In response to the commenter that noted that if two or more CAT Reporters are supplying the same information, regulators could effectively surveil if only one source of the data was correct, see FIF Letter at 58, the Commission believes that it is important that the audit trail contains consistently accurate information from all sources obligated to report data and that errors not be permitted to exist in the audit trail just because they were correctly reported by one party.</p>

One commenter requested clarification of the requirement for a bi-annual test of the CAT systems at the disaster recovery site. This commenter noted that &#8220;bi-annual&#8221; is commonly understood to mean twice a year, but can also mean once every two years. The commenter believed that clarification is necessary to ensure that the site is tested twice a year. It also believed that secondary equipment and critical personnel should be tested at least once a year. See FSI Letter at 5. In their response, the Participants affirmed that the bi-annual disaster recovery test of CAT operations at the secondary facility is required to be conducted twice a year.

      <p>1742 See DAG Letter at 4 (noting that the CAT NMS Plan estimates that 88% of the annual costs of CAT would be allocated to Industry Members, and that the Participants additionally intend to require Industry Members to help fund the creation and ongoing costs of CAT, significantly increasing the burden on Industry Members); KCG Letter at 4; SIFMA Letter at 12&#8211;13 (noting that the total estimated annual cost of the CAT NMS Plan would be $1.7 billion, of which $1.5 billion, or 88% of the costs for the operation of CAT, would be borne by Industry Members). One of these commenters stated that, although not mentioned in the CAT NMS Plan, it believed the Participants anticipate allocating 75% of CAT Central Repository build and operational costs to Industry Members and 25% to Execution Venues, thereby shifting the majority of CAT costs away from the SROs and on the Industry Members, and increasing the Industry Member portion of annual CAT&#8208;related costs from approximately 88% to more than 96%.

That commenter stated that &#8220;[t]his methodology is inequitable and serves to underscore the inherent conflicts of interest the SROs face with respect to CAT funding and the effects of precluding broker-dealers from meaningfully participating in management of the CAT.&#8221; KCG Letter at 4&#8211;5.</p>

      <p>1781 See Notice, supra note 5, at 30740. The Commission solicited comment on two Commission-proposed alternatives pertaining to fees imposed on ATSs. In the first alternative, the Commission proposed excluding ATS volume from TRF volume. The Commission stated that this alternative would allow SROs that operate TRFs (currently only FINRA) to avoid paying Execution Venue fees for volume originating from an ATS execution and would avoid double-counting ATS volume as share volume. See id. at 30768. The Commission also solicited comment on not charging Industry Members for message traffic to and from their ATSs while still assessing fees to ATSs as Execution Venues or exchange Industry Members for their message traffic. The Commission explained that this alternative would mitigate incentives for Industry Members to route their orders in order to minimize costs under the proposed funding model. Id.</p>

      <p>1783 Further, the Commission believes that the tiered fee structure effectively mitigates a concern expressed by a commenter that charging for message traffic would amount to a &#8220;financial transaction tax&#8221; that would negatively impact the financial markets.

      <p>1840 The CAT NMS Plan requires that CAT Reporters who are Industry Members synchronize their business clocks to within 50 milliseconds of the time maintained by the NIST, which will increase the precision of the timestamps provided by the 39% of broker-dealers who currently synchronize their clocks with less precision than what is called for by the Plan. See FIF Clock Offset Survey, supra note 247. Further, the Commission has amended the Plan to require exchanges to synchronize their business clocks to within 100 microseconds. While this is similar to current practice, this requirement should still provide the greater ability for regulators to sequence unrelated events in a market reconstruction by anchoring lifecycles to events at exchanges. Independent of the potential time clock synchronization benefits, the order linking data that will be captured in CAT should increase the proportion of events that could be sequenced accurately. This reflects the fact that some records pertaining to the same order could be sequenced by their placement in an order lifecycle (e.g., an order submission must have occurred before its execution) without relying on timestamps. This information may also be used to partially sequence surrounding events, particularly with the Plan modifications.</p>

      <p>1857 Id. at 45727. Accuracy refers to whether the data about a particular order or trade is correct and reliable. Completeness refers to whether a data source represents all market activity of interest to regulators, and whether the data is sufficiently detailed to provide the information regulators require. While current data sources provide the trade and order data required by existing rules and regulations, those sources generally do not provide all of the information of interest to regulators in one consolidated audit trail. Accessibility refers to how the data is stored, how practical it is to assemble, aggregate, and process the data, and whether all appropriate regulators could acquire the data they need. Timeliness refers to when the data is available to regulators and how long it would take to process before it could be used for regulatory analysis. As explained in the Baseline, <a href="#752bfd82-6d6b-4d83-abca-8f0c67d8f4f6">Section V.D.2</a>, infra, the trading and order data currently available to regulators suffers from deficiencies in all four dimensions.</p>

      <p>1921 As proposed, the CAT NMS Plan also requires CAT Reporters to synchronize their time clocks to the time maintained by the NIST with an allowable drift of 50 milliseconds. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8</a>. According to a survey conducted by the FIF, 39% of responding broker-dealers currently synchronize their clocks with less precision than what is called for by the CAT NMS Plan. Thus, the CAT NMS Plan would also increase the accuracy of the timestamps used by certain broker-dealers. See FIF Clock Offset Survey, supra note 247.</p>

      <p>1923 In this instance, &#8220;timeliness&#8221; refers to when the data are compiled at the source in question (e.g., when OATS receives data from reporting broker-dealers), not when they become available to regulators because that timeline can vary depending on the regulator in question. As shown in the &#8220;Direct Access for Regulators&#8221; column, it may still take several days, weeks, or months for regulators to be able to access the data. For example, while OATS reporters provide the data at T+1, the SEC must request OATS data in order to access it, which may take several days or weeks. This narrower definition of timeliness is not used throughout this economic analysis.</p>

      <p>1924 Guidance from FINRA indicates that broker-dealers must &#8220;identify the party to the trade&#8221; through EBS fields such as &#8220;Primary Party Identifier,&#8221; but that party may be another broker-dealer rather than the ultimate customer. See FINRA, Electronic Blue Sheet Submissions, FINRA and ISG Extend Effective Date for Certain Electronic Blue Sheet Data Elements, Regulatory Notice 12-47 (Oct. 2012), available at <a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p194655.pdf">https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p194655.pdf</a>. Similarly, under the large trader rule, persons exercising &#8220;investment discretion&#8221; are reported through EBS, but in some cases such persons are investment advisers rather than their customers. See Notice, supra note 5, at note 372 and accompanying text (discussing the large trader rule).</p>

      <p>1946 As used herein, the term &#8220;data errors&#8221; refers to instances where data reflect false information or are missing information such that they do not reflect order events that occurred in the market fully and accurately. Under this definition of &#8220;data errors,&#8221; a trading error or an order entry error would not be a &#8220;data error.&#8221; For example, if a trader submitted an order to an exchange with an order size of 100,000, an accurate order record would contain an order size of 100,000. If the trader actually intended to enter the order size as 1,000, the accurate order record would still be 100,000 because that would reflect the actual state of the market at the time. In other words, the 100,000 order size is not a &#8220;data error.&#8221; If the trader later corrected the order size, accurate data would reflect the subsequent corrections while still preserving the accurate state of the market at the time.</p>

      <p>2011 As proposed, the CAT NMS Plan also requires CAT Reporters to synchronize their time clocks to the time maintained by the NIST with an allowable drift of 50 milliseconds. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Section 6.8. According to a survey conducted by the Financial Information Forum (FIF), 39% of responding broker-dealers currently synchronize their clocks with less precision than what is called for by the CAT NMS Plan. Thus, the CAT NMS Plan would also increase the accuracy of the timestamps used by certain broker-dealers. See FIF Clock Offset Survey, supra note 247.</p>

      <p>2013 In this instance, &#8220;timeliness&#8221; refers to when the data are compiled at the source in question (e.g., when OATS receives data from reporting broker-dealers), not when they become available to regulators because that timeline can vary depending on the regulator in question. As shown in the &#8220;Direct Access for Regulators&#8221; column, it may still take several days, weeks, or months for regulators to be able to access the data. For example, while OATS reporters provide the data at T+1, the SEC must request OATS data in order to access it, which may take several days or weeks. This narrower definition of timeliness is not used throughout this economic analysis.</p>

      <p>2014 Guidance from FINRA indicates that broker-dealers must &#8220;identify the party to the trade&#8221; through EBS fields such as &#8220;Primary Party Identifier,&#8221; but that party may be another broker-dealer rather than the ultimate customer. See FINRA, Electronic Blue Sheet Submissions, FINRA and ISG Extend Effective Date for Certain Electronic Blue Sheet Data Elements, Regulatory Notice 12-47 (Oct. 2012), available at <a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p194655.pdf">https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p194655.pdf</a>. Similarly, under the large trader rule, persons exercising &#8220;investment discretion&#8221; are reported through EBS, but in some cases such persons are investment advisers rather than their customers. See supra note 1912 and accompanying text (discussing the large trader rule).</p>

      <p>2020 The Commission noted that SRO audit trails currently do not include the activity of firms that are not members of that SRO. And, currently only FINRA requires its members to report their off-exchange activity. While broker-dealers that trade off-exchange must be members of FINRA unless their activity fits the terms of the exemption in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f95cdbd5e50d6ce687b40285b6f028d2&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.240&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.240_115b9_61">Rule 15b9-1</a>, firms that qualify for the exemption in that rule and that are not FINRA members do not report their off-exchange activity to OATS. This exemption covers a large percentage of off-exchange activity. Broker-dealers that are not FINRA Members accounted for 48% of orders sent directly to ATSs in 2014, 40% in 2013, and 32% in 2012. Because all SROs are Participants in the Plan, under the Plan all broker-dealers with Reportable Events, including off-exchange, would be required to report the required CAT Data to the Central Repository.

      <p>2048 For example, the Completeness section in the Notice noted that the open/close indicator for equities does not exist in current data sources. See Notice, supra note 5, at 30681. The accuracy of the open/close indicator for equities would have been subject to Plan Processor discretion, because the Plan Processor would have had responsibility for defining the permitted values and interpreting when CAT Reporters would use such permitted values and the Plan Processor would not have had guidance from previous data sources on how to define or interpret such a field.</p>

      <p>2123 Although not currently required in the Plan, the Commission believes there would be additional benefit to event sequencing if off-exchange execution venues, including alternative trading systems and broker-dealer internalizers, were required to adhere to a more stringent clock synchronization standard. As discussed in Section IV.D.13.a, the Commission understands that certain Industry Members, such as ATSs and broker-dealers that internalize off-exchange order flow, today adhere to a finer clock synchronization standard. As the Participants conduct their annual reviews, the Commission expects them to consider proposing new clock synchronization standards whenever they determine the industry standard for CAT Reporters, or certain categories or systems thereof, has become more granular than required by the Plan at that time. In determining the appropriate industry standards for clock synchronization, the Commission has amended the Plan so that the SROs should apply industry standards based on the type of CAT Reporter or system, rather than the industry as a whole. Varied requirements would segment the broker-dealer community, and one commenter stated a desire to &#8220;avoid unnecessary market segmentation&#8221; with regard to clock synchronization. See FSR Letter at 8. See also <a href="#0361251e-3ef0-4ce3-bb3a-9b345a228c50">Section IV.D.13.a(1)</a>, supra. The Commission notes, however, that these venues are already segmented with respect to their position within the broker-dealer and also with respect to other broker-dealers that do not provide these services.</p>

      <p>2124 Note that broker-dealers that are not FINRA members are not subject to FINRA&#8217;s clock synchronization requirements and do not submit reports to OATS.

      <p>2125 As discussed in the Notice, this reflects the fact that some records pertaining to the same order could be sequenced by their placement in an order without relying on timestamps.

      <p>2126 While the 5% Error Rate covers data from CAT Reporters, the Plan Processor could create errors as well, for example, through the linking process. Further, the Plan does not include details on how the Plan Processor would perform the linking process, identify broken linkages, and seek corrected reports from CAT Reporters to correct broken linkages. Instead, the Plan defers key decisions regarding the validation process until the selection of a Plan Processor and the development of Technical Specifications. The CAT NMS Plan describes the Plan Processor&#8217;s responsibility for creating the Technical Specifications. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Technical Specifications">Section 6.9</a>.</p>

Id. at Appendix D, Section 1.2. This may help identify challenges in the linking process and allow for their early resolution.</p>

      <p>2140 In the Notice, the Commission discussed an alternative that would require the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> approach to allocation reporting linking. The Commission stated that linking allocations to order lifecycles would improve accuracy for many situations, particularly in one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one allocations. Further, the Commission explained that broker-dealers likely already maintain records that allow them to ensure that the allocations receive fair prices based on market executions, and requested comment on whether those systems could provide a key to accurately link allocations to lifecycles in many-to-many allocations. See Notice, supra note 5, at 30757-58. One commenter, however, stated that the &#8220;many-to-many relationships [between executions and allocations] do not allow unique linkages for all situations.&#8221; See FIF Letter at 90. This commenter did not refute the accuracy improvements that could come from linking allocations to order lifecycles. Another commenter opined that broker-dealers should and can track order allocation information, including in the many-to-many situation. See Data Boiler at 40. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that such linking would be beneficial relative to the Plan. However, the Commission also believes that allocation linking would be costly to implement, a belief supported by the commenter who provided additional information on the source of such costs. See FIF Letter at 90.</p>

Results must be viewable in the tool or downloadable in a variety of formats and support at least a result size of 5,000 or 10,000 records, respectively, with a maximum result size to be determined by the Plan Processor. With the user-defined direct query or bulk extraction, CAT must be able to support at least 3,000 daily queries, including 1,800 concurrently, and up to 300 simultaneous query requests, with no performance degradation.

In practice, the Commission understands that most exchanges generally retain data for at least six years, but at least one exchange does not retain data for six or more years.

      <p>2206 Under the Plan, SROs that are exchanges would still have the same real-time access to their own audit trail data as they currently do. The Commission does not expect that all SRO audit trails will be retired on implementation of the Plan because exchanges may use such audit trails to implement their CAT reporting responsibilities. CAT reporting requirements would require that exchanges collect and report audit trail information from their systems even if they elect to replace their current audit trails. However, CAT requirements may improve the completeness of real-time exchange audit trail data if the information that exchanges collect under the Plan is more complete than what they currently collect.</p>

      <p>2207 As noted, the SROs are generally currently able to access their own audit trail data on the same day of an event and the Commission is currently able to access some public data, like SIP and MIDAS, on the same day as an event. Further, OATS is available to FINRA at 8am on the day following an event. The Commission preliminarily does not expect the CAT NMS Plan would affect these regulators&#8217; access to most of these respective data sources.</p>

      <p>2242 In 2015, the Commission filed 807 enforcement actions, including 39 related to insider trading, 43 related to market manipulation, 124 related to broker-dealers, 126 related to investment advisers/investment companies, and one related to exchange or SRO duties, many of which involved trade and order data. In 2014, the Commission filed 755 enforcement actions, including 52 related to insider trading, 63 related to market manipulation, 166 related to broker-dealers, and 130 related to investment advisers/investment companies, many of which also involved trade and order data. See Year-by-Year SEC Enforcement Statistics, available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/newsroom/images/enfstats.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/news/newsroom/images/enfstats.pdf</a>. The total number of actions filed is not necessarily the same as the number of investigations. An investigation may result in no filings, one filing, or multiple filings. Additionally, trade and order data may be utilized in enforcement investigations that do not lead to any filings. Based on these numbers, the Commission estimates that 30&#8211;50% of its enforcement actions incorporate trading or order data. A portion of FINRA&#8217;s 1,397 disciplinary actions in 2014 and 1,512 in 2015 also involved trading or order data.

      <p>2246 During the financial crisis in 2008, the lack of direct access to audit trail data resulted in the Commission being unable to quickly and efficiently reconstruct market events. The state of OATS data in 2008 also limited FINRA&#8217;s ability to analyze and reconstruct the market during the financial crisis because FINRA could not yet augment its OATS data with exchange data and OATS did not include market maker quotations. As a result, regulators had little information about the role of short sellers in market events and the identity of short sellers during the financial crisis, for example.

      <p>2266 It is well established in the economics and political science literature that common knowledge among market actors can lead to the deterrence of behaviors. See, e.g., Schelling, Thomas, &#8220;The Strategy of Conflict: Prospectus for a Reorientation of Game Theory,&#8221; Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol. 2 No.3 (1958) and Ellsberg, Daniel, &#8220;The Crude Analysis of Strategic Choices,&#8221; American Economic Review, Vol. 51, No. 2 (1961). Therefore, market participants with knowledge of improvements in the efficiency of market surveillance, investigations, and enforcement, and consequently the increased probability of incurring a costly penalty, could be deterred from participating in violative behavior.</p>

      <p>2267 The Plan would allow regulators to more efficiently conduct cross-market and cross-product surveillance relative to surveillance using current data sources, and the requirement that data be consolidated in a single database would assist regulators in detecting violative (but not obvious) activity. To the extent that market participants are aware of the current challenges to regulators in performing cross-market surveillance and aggregating data across venues, and to the extent that they believe that their violative behavior is more likely to be detected if regulators&#8217; ability to perform those activities improves, they may reduce or eliminate violative behavior if the CAT Plan is approved.

      <p>2269 The Commission understands that SRO surveillances on topics such as insider trading and market manipulation do not incorporate data that identifies customers. Based on alerts from their surveillances, SROs may open a review that runs through several stages of data requests before identifying a customer. The Commission notes that SRO audit trails typically do not provide customer information but a recent FINRA rule change would require its members to report to OATS non-FINRA member customers who are broker-dealers.

      <p>2270 For example CAT Data would include Customer information, subaccount allocation information, exchange quotes, trade and order activity that occurs on exchanges, trade and order activity that occurs at broker-dealers that are not FINRA members, and trade and order activity that occurs at FINRA members who are not currently required to report to OATS. In addition CAT Data would require reporters to report data in milliseconds and would be directly available to non-FINRA regulators much faster than OATS is currently available to them.

      <p>2433 Similarly, adding an independent board or audit committee to the Plan&#8217;s governance structure could provide additional oversight of Plan decision-making and mitigate potential concerns about Plan Participants&#8217; conflicts of interest, but it could also decrease coordination in decision-making required for efficiently achieving the regulatory benefits of the Plan. Aside from the potential costs, the incremental benefits of these and other enhanced governance features (e.g., additional disclosure requirements) may be narrow in light of the other provisions discussed in the Notice, including the Commission&#8217;s ability to monitor whether the benefits of the CAT are being achieved and the provisions limiting the incentive and ability of Operating Committee members to serve the private interests of their employers, including rules regarding recusal of Operating Committee members from voting on matters that raise a conflict of interest.

      <p>2435 For example, while there are many diverse types of broker-dealers, it is not clear that increasing the number of broker-dealers representatives from 7 to 12 would add significantly to the diversity of views represented on the Advisory Committee, and by constituting a majority of Advisory Committee members, may give rise to a risk that broker-dealer voices would dominate Advisory Committee discussions, which could limit the diversity of views transmitted to the Operating Committee and thereby worsen Plan decision-making.</p>

      <p>2436 Similarly, constituting the industry portion of the Advisory Committee early, so that industry may have a greater voice with respect to selection of the Plan Processor and the operating procedures of the CAT, would not improve Plan decision-making where those views could be solicited from industry via the DAG.</p>

      <p>2492 The assessment is now required to include the following: (1) an evaluation of the information security program of the CAT to ensure that the program is consistent with the highest industry standards for protection of data; (2) an evaluation of potential technological upgrades based upon a review of technological developments over the preceding year, drawing on necessary technological expertise, whether internal or external; (3) an assessment of efforts to reduce the time to restore and recover CAT Data at a back-up site; (4) an assessment of how the Plan Processor and SROs are monitoring Error Rates and address the application of Error Rates based on product, data element or other criteria; and (5) a copy of the evaluation required by <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(c)</a> as to whether industry standards have evolved such that: (i) the clock synchronization standard in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(a)</a> should be shortened; or (ii) the required timestamp in <a href="CAT NMS Plan, Article VI - Functions and Activities of CAT System, Timestamps and Synchronization of Business Clocks">Section 6.8(b)</a> should be in finer increments; and (6) an assessment of whether any data elements should be added, deleted or changed.

Although the bi-annual assessment was required under the Plan and its costs would thus have been included in the Participants&#8217; cost estimates presented in the Plan, the requirements have changed such that the report is both produced more frequently and is presented in greater detail. Consequently, the Commission assumes that the majority of the cost of this report would not be covered by cost estimates presented in the Plan as filed, and is adding the cost of this reporting to its final cost estimates. To the extent that a less detailed bi-annual report was already included in the Participants&#8217; cost estimates, the revised cost estimate overestimates this reporting cost.</p>

      <p>2503 To estimate this number, the Commission drew from a recent Commission adopting release and an industry report. Specifically, the Commission&#8217;s Crowdfunding Adopting Release estimated that the audit costs for affected issuers would be $2,500 to $30,000. See Securities Act Release No. 9974 (October 30, 2015), <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/16/2015-28220/crowdfunding">80 FR 71499</a> (November 16, 2015). The Commission believes this estimate could be reasonable if the Company&#8217;s financials are of the same level of complexity as the larger issuers affected by the Crowdfunding rule, which is realistic because the Company is not publicly traded, is organized as a &#8220;business league&#8221;, and has a limited and predictable revenue stream. As an alternative estimate, the Commission estimated an audit cost of approximately $65,000 using an industry estimate of $479 in audit costs per $1 million in revenue, using the assumption that Company revenue will just offset expected costs of $139 million. See Audit Analytics report &#8220;Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees: A Twelve Year Trend,&#8221; October 9, 2014, available at <a href="http://www.auditanalytics.com/blog/audit-fees-and-non-audit-fees-a-twelve-year-trend/">http://www.auditanalytics.com/blog/audit-fees-and-non-audit-fees-a-twelve-year-trend/</a>. $479 x $139 = $64,665 ~ $65,000. The Commission incorporates the higher estimate from the two methodologies ($65,000) into its cost estimates.</p>

This clarification to the Plan, and comments received on this clarification, which are discussed in Section IV, imply disagreement with the Commission&#8217;s treatment of these costs as sunk costs in the Notice. The Commission notes that these costs have already been incurred, so are not attributable to the Approval of the Plan, but rather are costs associated with and anticipated by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. Furthermore, the recovery of these costs by the Participants does not change the cost to industry of the Plan; rather the costs comprise a transfer from one market participant type (Industry Members) to another (Participants). Consequently, the cost of the Plan to industry is unaffected. The Commission acknowledges that this transfer will increase broker-dealer costs and decrease Participant costs.</p>

      <p>2534 In reaching these conclusions, the Commission reviewed the detailed discussions of the Reporters Study survey methodology in the Plan and the survey form and instructions provided to respondents. See 6/23/14 entry on CAT NMS Plan website, available at <a href="http://www.catnmsplan.com/pastevents/index.html">http://www.catnmsplan.com/pastevents/index.html</a>. The Commission Staff also discussed with the Participants potential methodology adjustments in aggregating the CAT Reporters Study data. After Commission Staff discussions with the Participants, the Commission concluded that no methodology could address these fundamental issues with the survey data.</p>

      <p>2549 The Commission believes this decision is strategic and discretionary because FINRA data reveals that while many broker-dealers at these activity levels self-report most or all of their regulatory data, other broker-dealers outsource most or all of their regulatory reporting at these activity levels. At lower activity levels, most, but not all, broker-dealers outsource most if not all of their regulatory data reporting. The Commission is cognizant that some broker-dealers reporting fewer than 350,000 OATS ROEs per month can and do opt to self-report their regulatory data. However, based on conversations with broker-dealers, the Commission believes that most broker-dealers at these activity levels do not have the infrastructure and specialized staff that would be required to report directly to the Central Repository, and electing to self-report would be cost-prohibitive in most but not all cases.</p>

      <p>2554 Although the pricing function is assumed constant, as explained in the Notice, broker-dealer costs would increase because the number of ROEs they report through their service bureaus would increase under the Plan. See Notice, supra note 5, at 30721.</p>

      <p>2556 Based on discussions with broker-dealers described in the Notice, the Commission believes that very small broker-dealers are unlikely to have employees entirely dedicated to regulatory data reporting. Instead, other employees generally have duties that include dealing with service bureau matters and answering regulatory inquiries. The Commission assumes a full-time employee costs $424,350 per year. Id. at 30714, n.880.</p>

      <p>2558 Exemption or exclusion from OATS may be based on firm size or type of activity. Broker-dealers with exemptions or exclusions that relate to firm size are presumably relatively inactive. However, some firms may be exempted or excluded because they route only to a single OATS-reporting broker-dealer; this could encompass large firms that would be more similar to Insourcers.</p>

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that market participants currently spend $1.7 billion for regulatory data reporting, and estimates that market participants will spend $1.7 billion to report regulatory data under CAT.

      <p>2615 The Commission&#8217;s analysis of costs is not based on small versus large Industry Members, but rather is based on Insourcers versus Outsourcers. It is reasonable to assume that Insourcers, ELPs and Option Market Makers are large Industry Members because these market participants can be characterized as having high activity levels that would require capital levels that exceed the upper threshold for small Industry Members. For these three groups of CAT reporters, one year of duplicative reporting is estimated to cost $1.2 billion.

      <p>2621 As discussed in the Notice, the Insourcing/Outsourcing decision is correlated with firm size. Insourcers tend to be larger firms, as do ELPs and Options Market Makers. These firms are likely to have more internal systems and more complex internal systems that will likely be more expensive to retire. On the other hand, Outsourcers, new reporters and options floor brokers are likely to be smaller firms with fewer internal systems that are less complex for retirement. Furthermore, new reporters and options floor brokers are likely to have fewer internal reporting systems than other broker-dealers because they are unlikely to have current OATS reporting obligations.

      <p>2622 The Commission recognizes that there is uncertainty in the system retirement costs that broker-dealers will face generally. The estimates provided by the commenter are presented as a range, and the Commission&#8217;s assumptions of which firms would fall at the top and the bottom of the range have significant uncertainty. If all 1,800 broker-dealers anticipated to incur CAT reporting obligations bore $100,000 in system retirement costs, broker-dealer system retirement costs would be $180 million. The Commission believes system retirement costs will be far less than this because many broker-dealers currently have limited regulatory data reporting systems, and the majority of broker-dealers rely on service providers to perform much of their data reporting responsibilities.</p>

      <p>2623 The Commission recognizes that some new reporters and options floor brokers may choose to insource their CAT reporting activities, and thus may be considered similar in size and scope of operations to non-OATS reporting large firms. Because new reporters and options floor brokers do not currently report to OATS, the Commission believes that they will face lower system retirement costs than ELPs and Options Market Makers because the Commission believes many ELPs and Options Market Makers are members of an exchange that requires them to be able to report to OATS on request, while new small firms and options floor brokers are unlikely to be members of an exchange with this requirement.</p>

      <p>2655 See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Section D.12, and note 247. In the Notice, the Commission noted that the survey has two limitations pertinent to specific cost estimates provided in the summary of survey results. First, cost estimates are likely to be significantly downward biased. Individual responses to cost data were gathered within a range; for example, a firm would quantify its expected costs as &#8220;Between $500K and less than $1M&#8221; or &#8220;$2.5M and over.&#8221; When aggregating these responses, FIF generally used the range midpoint as a point estimate; however, for the highest response, the range minimum was used (i.e., &#8220;$2.5M and over&#8221; was summarized as $2.5M.) This is likely to have produced a significant downward bias in aggregate survey responses. Second, the survey included only broker-dealers and service bureaus, thus the data excludes exchanges. The Commission preliminarily believed this limitation would not significantly impact industry costs because all exchanges currently maintain clock synchronization standards finer than those discussed as alternatives.</p>

      <p>2662 The CAT NMS Plan states that the Vendor Study was distributed to 13 service bureaus or technology-providing firms identified by the DAG. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(i)(A)(3). 13 service bureaus x $109,197 &#215; 4.2 = $5,962,156.2. The 4.2 multiplier is the ratio between the total incremental ongoing charges to broker-dealers and the total incremental ongoing costs to service bureaus derived from the cost estimates above. See Notice, supra note 5, at 30763 n 1245. Note that the Commission erroneously reported in the Notice that costs were $1.4 million in implementation costs, but these estimated costs should have been $6 million in ongoing costs. The Commission believed clock synchronization costs are already included in cost estimates provided in the Vendor Study. In the Notice, the Commission explained its belief that these costs likely would ultimately be passed on to service bureaus&#8217; broker-dealer clients.

      <p>2684 See id. at Section 12(q). The Commission does not have the information necessary to precisely estimate the costs that are incurred by including OTC Equity Securities in the initial phase of the implementation of the CAT NMS Plan, because the Plan does not separately present the costs associated with OTC Equity Securities. Because of low trading activity in the OTC equity markets, any significant costs associated with including OTC Equity Securities would be in implementation costs. Further, broker-dealers that implement CAT Data reporting for NMS securities may not incur significant additional costs to implement CAT Data reporting for OTC Equity Securities.</p>

      <p>2689 The Commission also acknowledges that the costs associated with handling PII could create an incentive for service bureaus not to offer CAT Reporting services.

The Commission also notes that, pursuant to the exemptive relief granted by the Commission, the approach to the reporting of Customer information in the CAT NMS Plan could allow for the bifurcation of PII reporting from the reporting of order data.

      <p>2702 The Commission noted that, as discussed in the Plan, the Participants collected information from the Bidders regarding security and confidentiality during the RFP process, however, there was considerable diversity in the approaches proposed by the Bidders and the Participants chose to give the Plan Processor flexibility on many implementation details and state the requirements as a set of minimum standards. These requirements include both general security and PII treatment requirements. General security requirements are designed to address physical security, data security during transmissions, transactions, and while at-rest, confidentiality, and a cyber incident response plan. PII requirements include a separate PII-specific workflow, PII-specific authentication and access control, separate storage of PII data, and a full audit trail of PII access. Id.</p>

Except for the smallest exchanges, the trade-to-message ratios range from about 0.016 trades for every quote update to about 0.026 trades for every quote update and appear constant across market share levels. However, the smallest exchanges by market share have only about 0.001 trades for every quote update to about 0.009 trades for every quote update.</p>

      <p>2818 Since the time of the Notice, the Commission approved a new exchange, the Investors' Exchange, LLC (&#8220;IEX&#8221;), which is an independent SRO, and two sets of affiliated SROs merged, the NASDAQ Group and the ISE Group.</p>

      <p>2819 The Plan now includes twenty-one SROs with votes on the Operating Committee, including four sets of affiliated SROs and six independent SROs. Compared to the time of the Notice (see supra note 2811), the number of votes required for majority or Supermajority approval remains the same, but the number of SRO blocks required for approval or to block an approval has changed. Now, the NASDAQ-ISE Group has six votes instead of separate blocs of three votes each. A majority approval still requires eleven votes. This could include as few as three of the SROs and sets of affiliated SROs instead of the former four: the affiliated SROs that have six votes, the affiliated SROs that have four votes, and one other SRO or set of affiliated SROs. Supermajority approval still requires fourteen votes. This could include as few as four SROs and sets of affiliated SROs instead of the former five: the affiliated SROs that have six votes, the affiliated SROs that have four votes, the affiliated SROs that have three votes, and any additional SRO or group of affiliated SROs. Note also that, now, as few as two sets of affiliated SROs, instead of the former three, could block a Supermajority approval by casting eight &#8220;no&#8221; votes: the affiliated SROs with six votes, and the affiliated SRO with two votes.</p>

      <p>2822 Generally, smaller exchanges will have smaller fees. So, if there are profits, and each exchange receives the same nominal reimbursement amount, then the percentage reduction in fees from the redistributed profit will be greater for smaller exchanges, as they are starting with a smaller denominator in the ratio. This does not speak to the relative burden of compliance costs, however, which may still disadvantage smaller exchanges.</p>

      <p>2861 The Plan does not mandate the data ingestion format. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section A.1(b). In the Notice, the Commission recognized that the CAT Reporters Study found no difference in expected costs for a fixed format, but requested comment on why the costs may be similar when it would seem logical that allowing flexible data reporting formats would reduce costs for broker-dealers.

      <p>2961 See Notice, supra note 5, at 30752&#8211;53. Specifically, with regard to removal, the Commission noted that &#8220;[t]he Plan contains several provisions that would allow the Operating Committee to remove the Plan Processor&#8221;&#8212;including in specified circumstances by &#8220;only a Majority Vote&#8221; which &#8220;incentivizes the Plan Processor to perform well enough to avoid being removed&#8221; but that it &#8220;depend[s] significantly on strong oversight by the Operating Committee.&#8221; Id. at 30753. However, the Commission also noted that it &#8220;recognizes that the effort required to remove a Plan Processor could be significant&#8221; and that &#8220;significant switching costs could influence whether removing a Plan Processor despite poor performance makes economic sense&#8221;&#8212;such that &#8220;the Plan Processor may only need to perform well enough to keep the inefficiencies associated with their performance from exceeding the cost to switch to another Plan Processor.&#8221; Id.</p>

      <p>3121 Specifically, the commenter stated that allowing the SROs ownership, management, and control over the data, without direct SEC oversight and control, would have &#8220;serious and unacceptable&#8221; consequences, because there will be a limited number of user accounts allocated to the SEC; there may be limitations on the SEC&#8217;s access to the data for non-regulatory purposes; the potential exists for the CAT LLC to charge the SEC for accessing the CAT system and its data; the SEC does not participate directly in the governance of the CAT Plan; the CAT Plan Participants may dismiss the Plan Processor with no notice to the SEC; and the Plan Participants may make material changes to the functions and operations of the CAT NMS system (or matters related to the CAT data).</p>

      <p>3124 The Commission received one comment on its request for comment regarding the organizational structure. Better Markets opposes the for-profit nature of the CAT LLC and the fact that the Commission would not control that corporation.

      <p>3127 Data Boiler suggested receiving SIP data in real-time, but did so conditional on the Central Repository receiving the data in real-time. Because the SROs may already get SIP data in real-time for other purposes and the CAT reporting will be on T+1, the Commission still does not have sufficient information to fully analyze the alternative of receiving SIP data in real-time.

      <p>3129 FIF stated that the Plan does not need to require a specific approach to user management, but that the Plan should specify some functionality and criteria for evaluation of the approach. For example, the user management system should provide for on-boarding and support levels of entitlement. See FIF Letter at 129&#8211;30. The commenter did not provide further explanation that would allow the Commission to better understand the costs and benefits of specifying these functionalities or not specifying an approach.

      <p>3132 See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section D.12(c). Traditionally-hosted storage architecture is a model in which an organization would purchase and maintain proprietary servers and other hardware to store CAT Data. Infrastructure-as-a-service is a provisioning model in which an organization outsources the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware, servers, and networking components, to a third party who charges for the service on a usage basis.</p>

This requirement should allow regulators to evaluate certain trading activity. For example, trading patterns of reported and unreported trades may cause Participant or Commission staff to make further inquiries into the nature of the trading to ensure that the public was receiving accurate and timely information regarding executions and that market participants were continuing to comply with trade reporting obligations under Participant rules. Similarly, patterns in the transactions that are reported and unreported to the consolidated tape could be indicia of market abuse, including failure to obtain best execution for customer orders or possible market manipulation. The Commission and the Participants would be able to review information on trades not reported to the tape to determine whether they should have been reported, whether Section 31 fees should have been paid, and/or whether the trades are part of a manipulative scheme.</p>

      <p>3272 The Commission based this estimate on the internal burden estimate provided in the CAT NMS Plan related to the development of the CAT NMS Plan. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(iii) (stating &#8220;&#8230;the Participants have accrued, and will continue to accrue, direct costs associated with the development of the CAT NMS Plan. These costs include staff time contributed by each Participant to, among other things, determine the technological requirements for the Central Repository, develop the RFP, evaluate Bids received, design and collect the data necessary to evaluate costs and other economic impacts, meet with Industry Members to solicit feedback, and complete the CAT NMS Plan submitted to the Commission for consideration. The Participants estimated that they have collectively contributed 20 FTEs in the first 30 months of the CAT NMS Plan development process&#8221;). The Commission believed the staff time incurred for the development of the CAT NMS Plan would be comparable to the staff time incurred for the activities required of the Operating Committee and the Selection Committee for the creation and management of the Central Repository once the Plan is effective. (20 FTEs / 30 months) = 0.667 FTEs per month for all of the Participants to develop the CAT NMS Plan. Converting this into burden hours, (0.667 FTEs) x (12 months) x (1,800 burden hours per year) =14,407 initial burden hours for all of the Participants to develop the CAT NMS Plan. (14,407 burden hours for all Participants / 20 Participants) = 720 initial burden hours for each Participant to develop the CAT NMS Plan.</p>

      <p>3296 The Commission based this estimate on the internal burden estimate provided in the CAT NMS Plan for the development of the CAT NMS Plan. The Commission noted that the CAT NMS Plan describes the internal burden estimate for the development of the CAT NMS Plan as a cost the Participants will continue to accrue; therefore, the Commission preliminarily believed that it is reasonable to use this burden estimate as the basis for its ongoing internal burden estimate for the maintenance of the Central Repository, particularly as the Commission believed the reasons for the staff time incurred for the development of the CAT NMS Plan would be comparable to those of the staff time to be incurred by the Operating Committee and the Selection Committee for the continued management of the Central Repository. See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(iii) (stating &#8220;&#8230;the Participants have accrued, and will continue to accrue, direct costs associated with the development of the CAT NMS Plan. These costs include staff time contributed by each Participant to, among other things, determine the technological requirements for the Central Repository, develop the RFP, evaluate Bids received, design and collect the data necessary to evaluate costs and other economic impacts, meet with Industry Members to solicit feedback, and complete the CAT NMS Plan submitted to the Commission for consideration. The Participants estimate that they have collectively contributed 20 FTEs in the first 30 months of the CAT NMS Plan development process&#8221;). (20 FTEs / 30 months) = 0.667 FTEs per month for all of the Participants to continue management of the Central Repository. Converting this into burden hours, (0.667 FTEs) x (12 months) x (1,800 burden hours per year) = 14,407 ongoing annual burden hours for all of the Participants to continue management of the Central Repository.

      <p>3320 The Commission notes that throughout this Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, it is categorizing the FTE cost estimates for the Participants, as well as the broker-dealer respondents, that were provided in the CAT NMS Plan as an internal burden. To convert the FTE cost estimates into internal burden hours, the Commission: (1) divided the FTE cost estimates by a divisor of $424,350, which is the Commission&#8217;s estimated average salary for a full-time equivalent employee in the securities industry in a job category associated with regulatory data reporting; and then (2) multiplied the quotient by 1,800 (the number of hours a full-time equivalent employee is estimated to work per year). See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(ii)(C), n.192. The Participants represented that the cost per FTE is $401,440. The $401,440 figure used in the CAT NMS Plan was based on a Programmer Analyst&#8217;s salary ($193 per hour) from SIFMA&#8217;s Management &amp; Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2008, multiplied by 40 hours per week, then multiplied by 52 weeks per year. The Commission has updated this number to include recent salary data for other job categories associated with regulatory data reporting in the securities industry, using the hour and multiple methodology used by the Commission in its paperwork burden analyses. The Commission is using $424,350 as its annual cost per FTE for purposes of its cost estimates. The $424,350 FTE cost = 25% Compliance Manager + 75% Programmer Analyst (0.25) x ($283 per hour x 1,800 working hours per year) + (0.75) x ($220 per hour x 1,800 working hours per year). The $283 per hour figure for a Compliance Manager and the $220 per hour figure for a Programmer Analyst are from SIFMA&#8217;s Management &amp; Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by the Commission to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.</p>

      <p>3321 See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(iii)(B)(2). Of the $17,900,000 in aggregate total costs, $11,070,000 is identified (subtotal of FTE costs and outsourcing), but the remaining $6,830,000 is not identified in the CAT NMS Plan.

See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(iii). To estimate the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(b)(6)</a> written assessment burden, the Commission is dividing the result further by half. 0.667 FTEs required for all Participants per month to develop the CAT NMS Plan = (20 FTEs / 30 months). 0.667 FTEs x 6 months = 4 FTEs. 4 FTEs/ 2 = 2 FTEs needed for all of the Participants to create and submit the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a> document. 2 FTEs / 2 = 1 FTE needed for all of the Participants to review and comment on the written assessment. (1 FTE x 1,800 working hours per year) = 1,800 ongoing annual burden hours per year for all of the Participants to review and comment on the written assessment. (1,800 burden hours / 20 Participants) = 90 ongoing annual burden hours per Participant to review and comment on the written assessment prepared by the CCO. The Commission noted that this assessment must be filed with the Commission every two years and is providing an annualized estimate of the burden associated with the assessment as required for its Paperwork Reduction Act analysis. To provide an estimate of the annual burden associated with the assessment as required for its Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, Commission divided the 90 ongoing burden hours in half (over two years) = 45 ongoing annual burden hours per Participant to review and comment on the written assessment prepared by the CCO.</p>

      <p>3409 As it did when making its preliminary estimate, the Commission calculated the total estimated burden hours based on a similar formulation used for calculating the total estimated burden hours of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a>&#8217;s requirement for a document addressing expansion of the CAT to other securities. See Section VI.D.1.e., supra. Specifically, as noted above, the Commission assumed that the review and potential revision of the written assessment would be approximately one-half as burdensome as the document required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a> when making its preliminary estimate. The Commission then further divided the burden by half because this report is required to be furnished every two years.</p>
      <p>The Commission has amended the CAT NMS Plan to add more specificity to the requirement to provide the written assessment. As a result, the Commission now estimates that the written assessment would now be as burdensome (instead of half as burdensome) as the document addressing expansion required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a>. 2 FTEs needed for all of the Participants to create and submit the document required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a> (and now for all of the Participants to review and comment on the written assessment). (2 FTEs) x (1,800 working hours per year) = 3,600 ongoing annual burden hours per year for all of the Participants to review and comment on the written assessment. (3,600 burden hours per year) / (21 Participants) = 171.43 ongoing annual burden hours per Participant to review and comment on the written assessment prepared by the CCO.</p>
      <p>The Commission also has amended the CAT NMS Plan to require this assessment to be provided annually instead of once every two years. To account for this change, the Commission is no longer dividing the ongoing burden hours for providing the written assessment in half to determine the annualized estimate of the burden.</p>

      <p>3413 The Commission acknowledges the inherent difficulty in establishing precise burden estimates because the Commission does not know the exact method of data reporting the Participants would decide for broker-dealers. For these estimates, the Commission is relying, in part, on the cost data provided by the Participants in the CAT NMS Plan, and, as noted earlier, on its own estimates of the costs that broker-dealers are likely to face for CAT implementation and ongoing reporting in compliance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>.

      <p>3424 See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(i)(A)(2). The Reporters Study requested broker-dealer respondents to provide estimates to report to the Central Repository under two approaches. Approach 1 assumes CAT Reporters would submit CAT Data using their choice of industry protocols. Approach 2 assumes CAT Reporters would submit data using a pre-specified format. Approach 1&#8217;s aggregate costs are higher than those for Approach 2 for all market participants except in one case where service bureaus have lower Approach 1 costs. See supra note 2568. For purposes of this Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, the Commission did not rely on the cost estimates for Approach 2 because overall the Approach 1 aggregate estimates represent the higher of the proposed approaches. The Commission believed it would be more comprehensive to use the higher of the two estimates for its Paperwork Reduction Act analysis estimates.</p>

      <p>3527 See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(i)(A)(2). The Reporters Study requested broker-dealer respondents to provide estimates to report to the Central Repository under two approaches. Approach 1 assumes CAT Reporters would submit CAT Data using their choice of industry protocols. Approach 2 assumes CAT Reporters would submit data using a pre-specified format. Approach 1&#8217;s aggregate costs are higher than those for Approach 2 for all market participants except in one case where service bureaus have lower Approach 1 costs. Id. at Section B.7(b)(iii)(C)(2). For purposes of this Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, the Commission is not relying on the cost estimates for Approach 2 because overall the Approach 1 aggregate estimates represent the higher of the proposed approaches. The Commission believes it would be more comprehensive to use the higher of the two estimates for its Paperwork Reduction Act analysis estimates.</p>

      <p>3528 FIF Letter at 88, Table 6. The commenter based its implementation and ongoing estimates on a survey it conducted of broker-dealers to estimate the costs associated with the allocation report timestamp requirement. The commenter noted that the estimates do not account for all Insourcers (the cost estimates cover the 126 large OATS-reporting broker-dealer Insourcers, but not the 14 ELPs or 31 Options Market Makers), nor do they cover Outsourcing broker-dealers. The Commission believes those categories may not have been included in the estimates due to a lack of participation by such broker-dealers in the survey. The Commission is assuming, for its Paperwork Reduction Act cost estimates, that the portion of the estimates attributed by the commenter to service bureaus will be passed-through to their Outsourcing broker-dealer clients that rely on service bureaus to perform their regulatory data reporting. The Commission is thus applying the portion of the commenter&#8217;s cost estimates attributed to the 126 Insourcers to all 171 Insourcers, as well as the portion of the cost estimates attributed to the 13 service bureaus across the 1,629 broker-dealers that are categorized as Outsourcing broker-dealers.</p>

      <p>3553 See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(i)(A)(2). The Reporters Study requested broker-dealer respondents to provide estimates to report to the Central Repository under two approaches. Approach 1 assumes CAT Reporters would submit CAT Data using their choice of industry protocols. Approach 2 assumes CAT Reporters would submit data using a pre-specified format. Approach 1&#8217;s aggregate costs are higher than those for Approach 2 for all market participants except in one case where service bureaus have lower Approach 1 costs. Id. at Section B.7(b)(iii)(C)(2). For purposes of this Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, the Commission is not relying on the cost estimates for Approach 2 because overall the Approach 1 aggregate estimates represent the higher of the proposed approaches. The Commission believes it would be more comprehensive to use the higher of the two estimates for its Paperwork Reduction Act analysis estimates.</p>

See Section VI.D.1.e., supra.

See CAT NMS Plan, supra note 5, at Appendix C, Section B.7(b)(iii). 0.667 FTEs required for all Participants per month to develop the CAT NMS Plan = (20 FTEs / 30 months). 0.667 FTEs x 6 months = 4 FTEs. 4 FTEs/ 2 = 2 FTEs needed for all of the Participants to create and submit the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(i)</a> document. (2 FTEs) x (1/8) = 0.25 FTE to prepare and submit the report studying the impact of tiered fees on market liquidity. (0.25 FTE x 1,800 working hours per year) = 450 initial, one-time burden hours for all of the Participants to review and comment on the written assessment.
