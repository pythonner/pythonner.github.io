In addition, the criteria prohibit any disclosure of information regarding the Bid to the Voting Senior Officer and prohibit the Voting Senior Officer from disclosing any non-public information gained in his or her role as such. According to the SROs, these criteria are intended to insulate the Voting Senior Officer from any inside knowledge regarding the Bid (while also preventing any information about the evaluation process from being shared with staff preparing the Bidding Participant&#8217;s Bid) and to reduce any potential personal motivation that may exist that could improperly influence a Voting Senior Officer&#8217;s decisions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-4" NAME="fr_pz8-4">25</a></p>

After Bids are submitted,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-6" NAME="fr_pz8-6">30</a> Section VI(A) of the Plan provides that the Selection Committee will review them to determine which are Qualified Bids (i.e., Bids that contain sufficient information to allow the Voting Senior Officers to meaningfully assess and evaluate them).<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-3" NAME="fr_pz9-3">31</a> At this initial stage, if two-thirds or more of the Participants determine that a Bid does not meet the threshold for a Qualified Bid, the Bid will be eliminated from further consideration. The Participants believe this initial step will ensure that only those Bids meeting a minimum level of detail and sufficiency will move forward in the process, and insufficient Bids can be eliminated.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz9-4" NAME="fr_pz9-4">32</a></p>

One commenter recommends that the Selection Committee instead should only allow revised Bids: (1) after the first round of voting on the Shortlisted Bidders, at which time the list of Bidders would be narrowed to two; and (2) only for the purposes of confirming that the final two Bidders have proposals that meet the requirements of the approved CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-8" NAME="fr_pz25-8">124</a> The commenter also believes that, if revisions would require material changes to the Bid of either of the two remaining Bidders, both Bidders should be permitted to revise their Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-9" NAME="fr_pz25-9">125</a> This commenter is concerned that allowing Bidders to revise their Bids too early in the selection process could materially impact the depth and breadth of information that Bidders are willing to provide in their initial Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz25-10" NAME="fr_pz25-10">126</a> Under the Plan as proposed, the commenter believes that Bidders will not have a strong incentive to put forth their best ideas, processes, systems, and methods in response to the initial RFP, and will include only enough information to meet the Qualified Bidder threshold.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-3" NAME="fr_pz26-3">127</a> Contrary to this position, another commenter believes that all Bidders should be permitted to revise their Bids, based on the provisions contained in the approved CAT NMS Plan, and recommends removing the requirement that the Selection Committee grant permission to revise Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz26-4" NAME="fr_pz26-4">128</a></p>

          <p id="76934bc1-d30a-4487-8d93-89dd1e80611c">Another commenter expresses a concern related to information sharing with Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-9" NAME="fr_pz29-9">152</a> Specifically, the commenter believes that some Bidders may be affiliated or associated with members of the DAG and, therefore, may have access to information relating to DAG discussions that other Bidders do not.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz29-10" NAME="fr_pz29-10">153</a> The commenter further believes that all Bidders should have uniform information relating to DAG discussions and recommends that a formal process be developed under which the SROs disseminate information to all Bidders relating to DAG discussions that are relevant to the Bidding process.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-4" NAME="fr_pz30-4">154</a> Another commenter similarly stated that the Bidders and all other interested parties should have access to DAG discussions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-5" NAME="fr_pz30-5">155</a> The commenter recommended that all DAG meeting materials and minutes could be posted on the CAT NMS Plan Website to achieve this goal.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-6" NAME="fr_pz30-6">156</a></p>
          <p id="b9e140b1-8629-461c-a57b-fc6f9fa77115">In response to the concern that some Bidders will have access to the DAG discussions while others will not, the SROs state that, prior to consultation on any aspect of information included in a Bid, the SROs intend to require the execution of NDAs by members of the Advisory Committee or the DAG, thus facilitating communication and mitigating the confidentiality risks of proprietary Bidder information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-7" NAME="fr_pz30-7">157</a> Additionally, the SROs indicate that it will be a requirement that no member of the Advisory Committee or the DAG will have affiliations with Bidding entities, unless such members have functional separation between their representatives on the DAG and their representatives involved with entities preparing or participating in a Bid similar to those restrictions imposed on Bidding SROs under Section V(D) of the Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz30-8" NAME="fr_pz30-8">158</a></p>
          <p id="82a856e4-32a2-4fb0-963d-368f96546914">In response to comments recommending the dissemination of DAG materials, the SROs state that they are committed to holding an open dialogue with industry members during the development of the CAT NMS Plan and will host additional industry outreach events to communicate, among other updates, decisions and ongoing discussion topics from DAG meetings.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-9" NAME="fr_pz31-9">159</a> The SROs state that they will post to the CAT NMS Plan Website those materials from DAG discussions that are deemed to be non-confidential information regarding the CAT NMS Plan development and Bidder evaluation process, such as gap analyses regarding the sunsetting of existing regulatory systems.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-10" NAME="fr_pz31-10">160</a> However, the SROs state that not all DAG materials will be posted to the website in order to safeguard confidential information and maintain a fair process.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-11" NAME="fr_pz31-11">161</a></p>

      <p id="65f2f440-955e-4911-8c38-bfdfcaf6a9bb">After carefully considering the proposed Plan, the issues raised by the comment letters, and the Response Letter, including the commitments contained therein, the Commission has determined to approve the Plan pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3)(B) of the Act<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-12" NAME="fr_pz31-12">162</a> and Rule 608,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-13" NAME="fr_pz31-13">163</a> in that it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a national market system.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz31-14" NAME="fr_pz31-14">164</a> <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> mandates that the SROs develop the CAT NMS Plan, and the SROs have voluntarily filed this Plan for the purpose of facilitating that development. The Commission believes the Plan is reasonably designed to govern the process by which the SROs will formulate and submit the CAT NMS Plan, including the review, evaluation, and narrowing down of Bids in response to the RFP, and ultimately choosing the Plan Processor that will build, operate, and maintain the consolidated audit trail. The Commission believes that the Plan should thereby help promote the goals of investor protection, and fair and orderly markets, by describing the process of developing the CAT NMS Plan, selecting a Plan Processor, and ultimately creating the consolidated audit trail, which will substantially enhance the ability of the SROs and the Commission to oversee today&#8217;s securities markets and fulfill their responsibilities under the federal securities laws.</p>
      <p id="61bb8d8f-0a7c-48e4-ad59-79129222c608">The Commission notes that, in response to the comments regarding industry participation in the selection process,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-3" NAME="fr_pz32-3">165</a> the SROs state that the DAG is a valuable source of input for the development of the CAT NMS Plan, and commit to provide the DAG with anonymized information taken from Bids with enough specificity to allow the DAG to understand the comparative advantages and disadvantages of the options being considered so that the DAG can contribute in a meaningful way to the SROs&#8217; analysis of Bid information.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-4" NAME="fr_pz32-4">166</a> The SROs also commit to continue to work with the DAG to identify the particular sections of the RFP that will benefit from industry input, and to solicit the views of the DAG and the industry for the required cost-benefit analysis, while adhering to their responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of the Bid submissions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz32-5" NAME="fr_pz32-5">167</a> The Commission believes that such an ongoing and open dialogue between the SROs and the DAG during the selection process is appropriate, and will facilitate the drafting of a detailed and thoughtful CAT NMS Plan, as contemplated by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a>. The Commission encourages the SROs to consult with and utilize the DAG to inform their decision making processes.</p>
      <p id="aab6e65f-87e0-4e22-a6d3-785fa615af0a">With respect to the comments on the transparency of the selection process,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-3" NAME="fr_pz33-3">168</a> the SROs reiterate their commitment to provide transparency to the industry during the selection process and thereafter, and agree to provide more detailed descriptions of their evaluation criteria in the RFP.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-4" NAME="fr_pz33-4">169</a> The SROs, however, recognize the need to balance full transparency with Bidder concerns about the confidentiality of proprietary information, in addition to more general concerns about inhibiting an open dialogue during the decision-making process. In light of these concerns, the SROs decline to publish the contents of the Bids, the Operating Committee minutes, or the SRO voting results.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-5" NAME="fr_pz33-5">170</a> The Commission believes in the importance of a transparent process with respect to the development of the CAT NMS Plan and to the selection of a Plan Processor, but at the same time recognizes the legitimate concerns of Bidders regarding the confidentiality of proprietary and other sensitive information, and the desire by the SROs to encourage Bidders to provide sufficiently detailed Bids to facilitate the development of a robust CAT NMS Plan. The Commission believes that the SROs have appropriately balanced these competing goals as described above.</p>
      <p id="82fa9b98-b403-42eb-a175-0a49a390d0eb">To address concerns regarding potential conflicts of interest in the selection process,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz33-6" NAME="fr_pz33-6">171</a> the SROs included in the Plan multiple provisions that are intended to balance the need for SROs to participate in the process given the important regulatory obligations that exist for each of them with respect to the creation and operation of the CAT, with the potential for conflicts of interest that can arise when an SRO is a Bidding Participant.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-4" NAME="fr_pz34-4">172</a> The Commission believes that the SROs have included reasonable steps to address the concerns about conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p id="5b74d9f4-305f-4f2a-9fb0-3d7beb7e119c">With regard to the issue of when and under what circumstances Bidders should be permitted to revise their Bids, one commenter encourages the SROs to liberalize the proposed Plan&#8217;s approach to allowing revisions while another commenter suggests that the SROs increase restrictions on the ability of Bidders to revise their Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-5" NAME="fr_pz34-5">173</a> In their Response Letter, the SROs state that they will not modify their proposal to permit each Shortlisted Bidder the opportunity to revise its Bid only if a majority of the Selection Committee believes that revisions by the particular Bidder are &#8220;necessary or appropriate.&#8221; As noted above, the SROs believe that without SRO discretion to determine which Bidders can revise their Bids, Bidders may not provide detailed information in their initial Bids, but will await the final structure of the CAT NMS Plan to provide full information in their revised Bids.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-6" NAME="fr_pz34-6">174</a> The Commission believes that the SROs&#8217; approach is reasonably designed to help assure that the SROs receive sufficiently detailed information to develop the CAT NMS Plan.</p>
      <p id="d6e91da4-8a40-4fc3-ac25-31edae9f08bc">With respect to the comments raised by a commenter relating to the due date for Bids<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-7" NAME="fr_pz34-7">175</a> (four weeks after Commission approval of the Selection NMS Plan), the Commission notes that the SROs explain that the timeframe is based on the current requirement to submit the CAT NMS Plan by September 30, 2014, and note that, if the approved Plan has a material impact on the Bidders&#8217; ability to respond to the RFP, then the SROs may extend this date.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz34-8" NAME="fr_pz34-8">176</a> Regarding the comments made by another commenter relating to the two-month period for the selection of the Plan Processor,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-4" NAME="fr_pz35-4">177</a> the Commission notes that this is a deadline imposed by Rule 613(a)(3)(i)<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-5" NAME="fr_pz35-5">178</a> and that the SROs state that they hope to meet this deadline but will continue to evaluate whether, and, if so, how much, additional time may be required, and will seek additional time from the Commission for the selection of the Plan Processor if needed.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-6" NAME="fr_pz35-6">179</a></p>
      <p id="cc4ccdcd-4533-4aa7-b926-9a687d955dc8">With respect to the comment regarding the quorum requirement for Selection Committee meetings,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-7" NAME="fr_pz35-7">180</a> the Commission notes that the SROs state that they will ensure that all Voting Senior Officers will be in attendance for all voting processes as part of the Plan Processor selection, either in person or telephonically.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-8" NAME="fr_pz35-8">181</a> With respect to the concerns regarding information sharing,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-9" NAME="fr_pz35-9">182</a> the Commission notes that, in addition to requiring NDAs, the SROs have indicated that no member of the Advisory Committee or the DAG will be permitted to have affiliations with Bidding entities, unless such members have functional separation between their representatives on the DAG and their representatives involved with entities preparing or participating in a Bid.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz35-10" NAME="fr_pz35-10">183</a></p>
      <p id="dfba35cf-0664-4607-8f83-5d49b6c8a2ac">The Commission finds that the Plan is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a national market system and that it is reasonably designed to achieve its objective of facilitating the development of the CAT NMS Plan and the selection of the Plan Processor. Accordingly, the Commission expects that the Participants will implement the Plan as described, and complete the evaluation of the Bids and submission of the CAT NMS Plan as required by Rule 613.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz36-6" NAME="fr_pz36-6">184</a></p>

Lazo, Managing Director and Associate General Counsel, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (&#8220;SIFMA&#8221;), dated December 23, 2013 (&#8220;SIFMA Letter&#8221;); from Manisha Kimmel, Executive Director, Financial Information Forum (&#8220;FIF&#8221;), dated December 23, 2013 (&#8220;FIF Letter&#8221;); Anonymous (&#8220;Anonymous 2&#8221;), dated December 23, 2013 (&#8220;Anonymous 2 Letter&#8221;) from Manisha Kimmel, Executive Director, FIF, dated January 24, 2014 (&#8220;FIF Letter II&#8221;).</p>
      <p>FINRA notes that it has two roles with respect to the development of the consolidated audit trail: (1) a role as a Participant in developing the CAT NMS Plan (as defined below) (&#8220;SRO Side&#8221;) and (2) a role as an entity that has submitted an intent to submit a Bid (as defined below) in response to the RFP (as defined below) (&#8220;Bid Side&#8221;). FINRA notes that it has implemented a communications firewall between the SRO Side and the Bid Side, including policies and procedures designed to prevent the members of the SRO Side and the Bid Side from communicating with one another about non-public matters involving the consolidated audit trail. The FINRA Letter was submitted by the Bid Side. See FINRA Letter at 1.</p>

      <p>21 Section IV of the Plan governs amendments to the Plan. In general, except with respect to the addition of new Participants, any change to the Plan requires a written amendment that sets forth the change, is executed by over two-thirds of the Participants, and is approved by the Commission pursuant to Rule 608 of the Act or otherwise becomes effective under Rule 608.</p>

      <p>22 Initial steps in the evaluation and selection process will be performed pursuant to the Plan; the final two rounds of evaluation and voting, as well as the final selection of the Plan Processor, will be performed pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan. The sections of the CAT NMS Plan governing these final two voting rounds are set forth in Sections VI(D) and (E) of the Plan and will be incorporated into the CAT NMS Plan. The Participants believe it is essential that the entire process be laid out in the Plan so that the Commission can consider and approve the entire evaluation and selection process, even though the final two voting rounds, including the selection of the Plan Processor, will not be conducted until after the approval of the CAT NMS Plan.

See Section I(E) of the Plan. A &#8220;Material Subcontractor&#8221; is &#8220;any entity that is known to the Participant to be included as part of a Bid as a vendor, subcontractor, service provider, or in any other similar capacity and, excluding products or services offered by the Participant to one or more Bidders on terms subject to a fee filing approved by the SEC, (1) is anticipated to derive 5% or more of its annual revenue in any given year from services provided in such capacity; or (2) accounts for 5% or more of the total estimated annual cost of the Bid for any given year.&#8221; See Section I(J) of the Plan. The Plan provides that &#8220;[a]n entity will not be considered a &#8216;Material Subcontractor&#8217; solely due to the entity providing services associated with any of the entity&#8217;s regulatory functions as a self-regulatory organization registered with the SEC.&#8221; See id.</p>
