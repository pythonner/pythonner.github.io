        <p id="2e0df642-34bf-46ab-b8f7-f24c4d6bf570">As described in more detail below, Amendment No. 1 would revise the Selection Plan to allow the SROs to accept revised Bids prior to Commission approval of the CAT NMS Plan and allow the SROs to narrow the list of Shortlisted Bids prior to Commission approval of the CAT NMS Plan. The SROs believe that providing the Shortlisted Bidders with an additional opportunity (or opportunities) to revise their Bids prior to the approval of the CAT NMS Plan is critical to the timely and considered selection of the CAT Plan Processor, and more importantly, the adherence to the other timelines for the CAT NMS Plan set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-8" NAME="fr_pz3-8">13</a> The SROs state that since the time the Bidders submitted their Bids, the SROs have gathered and evaluated data and information from a variety of market participants, including Bidders, broker-dealers, vendors, regulators and others, and have made progress in developing an optimal solution and formalizing the solution in the proposed CAT NMS Plan and related technical documents.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz3-9" NAME="fr_pz3-9">14</a> Given these developments, the SROs believe that Bidders should be permitted to revise their Bids using the new information provided in the proposed CAT NMS Plan and technical documents prior to approval of the CAT NMS Plan.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-8" NAME="fr_pz4-8">15</a> The SROs also state that given the passage of time since the Bids were submitted, Bidders have indicated that new technological and other beneficial solutions are now available that may further improve the Bids, and, ultimately, the proposed solutions.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-9" NAME="fr_pz4-9">16</a></p>
        <p id="3b72a9de-9552-4432-94b8-ea44a0f77373">The SROs also explain that given the large amount of information they expect will be included in any revised Bids and the importance of appropriately analyzing such information, the SROs do not believe that two months will be sufficient to select the CAT Plan Processor from as many as six Shortlisted Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-10" NAME="fr_pz4-10">17</a> However, the SROs believe that if the existing Shortlisted Bidders were able to revise their Bids, including the option to reflect any new technology or other relevant developments, the SROs could further narrow the list of Shortlisted Bidders to better facilitate the ultimate selection of the CAT Plan Processor within the time limits imposed by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613</a> in an appropriately thoughtful and deliberative manner.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz4-11" NAME="fr_pz4-11">18</a></p>

      <p id="da4b0ae6-809a-46c0-95df-e7572fbf9960">As noted above, the Commission received one comment letter from FIF. FIF, on behalf of its Consolidated Audit Trail Working Group, supports Amendment No. 1 but offers two recommendations.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-4" NAME="fr_pz6-4">24</a> First, FIF recommends, in the interest of efficiency, that the Participants narrow the list of Bidders before any revision of Bids takes place. FIF believes that in view of the substantial efforts already undertaken by the Participants, there should be sufficient information for the Participants to take action and narrow the list of Bidders. FIF argues that it is unnecessary to require all six of the current Shortlisted Bidders to revise their Bids. Further, FIF argues that narrowing the list of Bidders prior to permitting the revision of Bids would reduce the amount of effort the SROs would need to expend in reviewing the revised Bids.</p>
      <p id="74aac8a1-44b9-4b1d-aff3-185cb2a4fd65">Second, FIF recommends that once the Participants further narrow the list of Shortlisted Bidders, each of the remaining Bidders should receive detailed information on Order Audit Trail System (&#8220;OATS&#8221;), electronic blue sheets (&#8220;EBS&#8221;), and Large Trader so that Bidders can consider all of the required functionality to retire these systems in preparing their revised Bids. FIF notes that the retirement of these systems is critical to managing the cost of CAT&#8217;s implementation, and additional information concerning the functionality required to retire these systems would aid in revising Bids. FIF believes that understanding the precise functional requirements for retiring OATS is critical and imperative for a level playing field among Bidders.</p>
      <p id="211683fa-96e9-405c-a1af-01e19a7963d9">The SROs considered FIF&#8217;s recommendations, but declined to propose modifications to the Amendment.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz6-5" NAME="fr_pz6-5">25</a> With regard to FIF&#8217;s suggestion that the SROs narrow the list of Bidders before allowing any revisions to the Bids, the SROs state that one of the main purposes of the Amendment is to provide greater flexibility to the SROs to narrow the list of Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-12" NAME="fr_pz7-12">26</a> The SROs, however, note that they recognize the value of a streamlined process for all parties and intend to consider this factor, among others, in determining when to narrow the list of Shortlisted Bidders.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-13" NAME="fr_pz7-13">27</a></p>
      <p id="70bcbe41-44b6-4aa8-b532-ca4fd742e198">The SROs concur with FIF in the significance of retiring overlapping and redundant systems, but do not see this as linked to the proposed amendment to the Selection Plan. The SROs reiterate their commitment to the retirement of systems as provided in the CAT NMS Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz7-14" NAME="fr_pz7-14">28</a> noting that the Plan describes the major data attributes that will be required to retire such systems. Going forward, as additional technical specifications are developed in accordance with milestones included in the CAT NMS Plan, the SROs will provide this information to Bidders.</p>

The Commission believes Amendment No. 1 would provide the SROs with additional flexibility with respect to the process of reviewing Shortlisted Bids and selecting the CAT Plan Processor. Such additional flexibility is aimed at allowing the SROs to be more efficient in selecting the CAT Plan Processor, which is particularly important given additional deadlines contained in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)(3)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-3" NAME="fr_pz8-3">29</a> The Commission believes that the SROs&#8217; explanation that they prefer to retain flexibility in the process to select the Plan Processor, without any additional conditions or restrictions, in response to FIF&#8217;s suggestion that they narrow the list of Bidders before allowing Bidders to revise their Bids, is reasonable. Permitting the SROs to accept revised Bids prior to Commission approval of the CAT NMS Plan, and to narrow the number of Shortlisted Bids prior to Commission approval of the CAT NMS Plan,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-4" NAME="fr_pz8-4">30</a> will allow the SROs to position themselves to avoid any delays in selecting the CAT Plan Processor,<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-5" NAME="fr_pz8-5">31</a> thus removing any impediments to meeting the additional deadlines set forth in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b6877b9e1830e7e40c606dc443096e5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt17.4.242&amp;rgn=div5#se17.4.242_1613">Rule 613(a)(3)</a>.<a class="sup" HREF="#fn_pz8-6" NAME="fr_pz8-6">32</a></p>
